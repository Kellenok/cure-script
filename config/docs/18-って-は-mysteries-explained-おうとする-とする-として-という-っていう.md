こんにちは。

Today we're going to talk about <code>trying to do something</code>

and from there we're going to broaden out into the wider meanings of the <code>と</code> quotation particle because this is a very central part of Japanese that's used all the time.

So we need to get a firm understanding of what it is and how it works.

Now, last week *(Lesson 17)* we learned the volitional helper う and よう which makes a word end with the sound <code>おう</code> or <code>よう</code> and expresses will.

![](media/image657.png)

**If we're <code>trying</code> to do something we use the volitional for this.**

So if we say, <code>山に**のぼろうとする**</code>, this means <code>**try to climb** mountain</code>.

Why does it mean that? What's this construction actually doing?

![](media/image71.png)

Well, <code>のぼ**ろう**</code> **expresses the will to climb.**

![](media/image1092.png)

If we say <code>山にのぼ**ろう**</code>, we're saying, <code>**Let's** climb the mountain</code>.

Literally, **set our will toward climbing the mountain.**

## おうとする / とする

<code>のぼろう**とする**</code> **means doing the act implied by setting our will to climb the mountain.**

If we just wanted to say <code>climb the mountain</code>, we'd just say, <code>山にのぼる</code>.

But we're not saying <code>climb the mountain</code>, we're saying <code>**try to** climb the mountain</code>.

**Therefore, do the action implied in setting our will / enact our will to climb the mountain,**

**whether we succeed in actually climbing it or not.**

Some people find the distinction between <code>try climbing</code> and <code>try to climb</code> confusing.

And that's really only because of the way it's expressed in English.

![](media/image571.png)

**In Japanese**, as we learned recently *(Lesson 16)*, **if we want to say,**

<code>**try** climbing the mountain</code>, we say, <code>山にのぼ**ってみる**.</code>

**The difference is that <code>try climbing / try eating / try swimming</code> doesn't imply any doubt**

**about the fact that we can actually do it.**

**It implies doubt about what would be the result when we've done it.**

---

**<code>Try eating</code> - we know we can eat, but don't know if we'll like it.**

<code>Try eating</code> - <code>食べてみる</code> - means <code>eat and see</code>.

Eat it and then see what the result is, see if you like it, see if you don't like it.

---

<code>山にのぼってみる</code> means <code>climb the mountain and see</code>.

See whether it was hard, see what the view's like from the top.

---

<code>ケーキを**食べようとする**</code> - <code>**try to eat** the cake</code> - implies that we don't know whether

you can in fact eat the cake or not, but try it anyway.

Maybe it's a huge cake and it would be very hard to eat it all.

So <code>してみる</code> - <code>do and see</code> - **implies that there's no doubt about the fact that we can do it, but there is some doubt about what the result of having done it is going to be.**

Are we going to like it?

Is the building going to fall down?

We don't know what will happen when we've done it, but we know we can do it.

**<code>しようとする</code> implies that we don't know whether we can do it or not,**

**but we are going to try to do it.**

---

So, an important thing here is to see what the と-particle is doing.

**-と is encapsulating the sentence that came before it:**

<code>山にのぼろう</code> - will to climb the mountain.

**It isn't quoting it.**

**It's not something we've said; it's not something we've thought, exactly.**

**The point is that it's taking the essence, the meaning, the import of that <code>山にのぼろう</code>**

**and putting it into action.**

And we're going to find that in other cases.

![](media/image999.png)

For example, we may read that someone <code>ホッ**とした**</code> . Now, what does that mean?

<code>ホッ</code> is in fact a sound effect.

It's the sound effect of breathing a sigh of relief: <code>ホッ</code>.

**But <code>ホッとする</code> actually does not mean <code>breathe a sigh of relief</code>.**

What it means is, **<code>feel relief / be relieved</code>**.

---

**So what we're doing here is enacting the idea, the feeling, expressed in <code>ホッ</code>, the sigh of relief.**

**Just as in <code>山にのぼろうとする</code> we're enacting the feeling,**

**the import of setting our will toward climbing the mountain, that is, trying to climb it.**

### とする & にする

Now, similarly, if we say <code>さくらを**日本人と**する</code>, it means **regarding Sakura as a Japanese person.**

![](media/image80.png)

Now, we might also say, <code>さくらを**日本人に**する</code>, but that means something quite different.

It means <code>**turn Sakura into a Japanese person**</code>.

**に is the target of an action.**

---

A little while ago we had a lesson *(Lesson 8)* in which we talked about

<code>さくらが**かえるになる**</code> - <code>Sakura **becomes a frog**</code>.

![](media/image943.png)

Now, we've also talked about *(Lesson 15)* the way that <code>ある</code> and <code>する</code> are the Eve and Adam of Japanese verbs,

![](media/image662.png)

<code>ある</code> being the primary self-move verb and <code>する</code> the primary other-move verb.

**<code>なる</code> is very closely related to <code>ある</code> - <code>ある</code> is <code>be</code>, <code>なる</code> is <code>become</code>.**

And **so if we say <code>になる</code> it means to become something.**

**If we say <code>にする</code> that's the other-move version of <code>になる</code>.**

It means to <code>turn something into something</code>.

So if we say, <code>まじょがさくらを**カエルにした**</code> - <code>the witch **turned** Sakura **into a frog**</code>.

![](media/image290.png)

::: info
カエル is just another way to write frog, via katakana. Animals are usually written that way.  
:::

<code>さくらを**日本人にする**</code> - **turning** Sakura **into a Japanese person**;

but <code>さくらを**日本人とする**</code> - **regarding** Sakura **as a Japanese person** / **taking** Sakura **as a Japanese person.**

![](media/image653.png)

<code>かばんをまくら**とする**.</code>

![](media/image16.png)

<code>かばん</code> is <code>bag</code>, <code>まくら</code> is <code>pillow</code> and this means <code>using your bag as a pillow</code>.

**You're not turning your bag into a pillow, it's not becoming a pillow,**

**but you're regarding it as one and using it as one.**

So here we have some of the uses of <code>-とする</code>.

**Generally speaking, it relates to how we regard something.**

## として

Now, **if we say <code>-として</code>, this isn't so much the act of regarding something as something,**

**but seeing something in the light of being something.**

So, in English it would usually be translated simply as <code>**as**</code> or <code>**for**</code>. Or <code>**being in the role of**</code>

![](media/image905.png)

So, <code>こじん/個人**として**の いけん/意見</code> means <code>my opinion **as** a private person</code>, as opposed to, say, <code>my opinion **as** president of the Frog Jockey Society.</code> *- just another example sentence (contrast in words <code>private person</code> & <code>president</code>), not some difference in the function of として. The wording may delude to Dolly meaning it as if it was として that had an opposing role there.*

Or we could say, <code>アメリカ人**として**小さい</code> - "She's small **for** an American / **As** an American, she's small.

So we can see that **the quotation function of -と is used not only to quote ideas and thoughts, but also to take the feeling of something and bundle it up and then say something about it.**



::: info
just in case, this comment may help some in regards to とする & として.

![](media/image551.png)
:::

## という / と言う

Of course, **the most basic thing that can follow -と is <code>いう</code>,**

**in which case it's a literal quotation**,

**-という/と言う** (it's usually pronounced not so much <code>-という</code> but as <code>-とゆ</code>).

And **this again can be used not just in a literal quotation but also saying**

**how something is said or what it's called.**

So, <code>ふしぎの国のアリス**という**本</code>, means <code>book **called** ふしぎの国のアリス</code>

![](media/image546.png)

### っていう / って言う

**And the -と in <code>-という</code> can be reduced simply to -って.**

So we can say <code>-っていう</code> - <code>ふしぎの国のアリス**っていう**本</code>,

**or it can be reduced down to just -って.**

![](media/image1071.png)

<code>ふしぎの国のアリス**って**本</code> still means <code>The book **called** Alice in Wonderland</code>.

So people sometimes get a little confused when they just see this -って.

**It means -と or -という**, but the thing that really confuses people sometimes is that

**it can also be used in place of the は-particle.**

### って used in place of は

Now, this seems particularly strange, until you realize what it's actually doing.

If we remember what the は-particle is, the は-particle is the topic-marking particle.

So when we say <code>さくら**は** *(zeroが)* 日本人だ</code>, we can put that into English as

<code>**Speaking of** Sakura, (she) is Japanese person</code>.

Now, does that start to make things a little clearer?

![](media/image501.png)

<code>さくら**って**(zeroが)日本人だ</code> - <code>Sakura **-say**, (she) Japanese-person is</code> -

<code>Sakura **-speaking of**, (she) Japanese-person is</code> - <code>Sakura **(topic)**, (she) Japanese-person is</code>.

Now, **we can't say -と or -という in place of the は-particle.**

**It's a very casual use.**

**We just use -って.**

But you can see that it's really, **even though it's very colloquial**,

it's not just some random and inexplicable thing.

**It's setting up Sakura as the thing we're talking about, just as は is.**

Now, there are other extended uses of -と.

We'll cover those as we come to them.
