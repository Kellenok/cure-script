[**Outer Limits! 限る Kagiru 限り Kagiri - Its many meanings and how they work 知っている限り、とは限らない and more**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWCLPJwZS5E&list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj&index=96&ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly)

こんにちは。

Today we're going to talk about <code>限る</code> and <code>限り</code>.

**<code>限る</code> is a verb meaning <code>limit</code> or <code>restrict</code>,**

and **<code>限り</code> is the い-stem, therefore the noun-form of that verb.**

![](media/image270.png)

If you don't know about い-stems making noun-forms,

I'll link a video above my head which tells you all the secrets of the mysterious い-stem.  
*(Lesson 72)*

Now, **Japanese likes limiting expressions, expressions to do with limits and boundaries.**

[**I did a video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56sy0qfY0Js) on <code>うち</code> *(Lesson 97)* a little while ago  
and I'll put a link above my head and in the information section below.

<code>うち</code> concentrates on the enclosure, on the area that we're in

and everything else is outside of.

**<code>限り</code>, on the other hand, concentrates on the boundaries of that enclosure,**

**the edges beyond which the enclosure does not reach.**

And this gives rise to a whole range of expression strategies,

some of which are quite literal, others of which are very metaphorical

and can confuse people if they don't understand where they're coming from.

## 限る

**So, let's start with a very simple use of <code>限る</code>.**

<code>出席は招待者に**限る**</code>

**<code>出席</code> is attendance at whatever the event may be.**

**It is limited at <code>招待者</code> (invited persons).**

**Outside that limit, <code>出席</code> doesn't exist.**

**You can't attend the meeting or whatever unless you are an invited person.**

![](media/image561.png)

Now, another mainly literal use is <code>声の**限りに**呼んだ</code> (I called **at the limit** of my voice).

![](media/image977.png)  
In English we might say <code>the top of my voice</code>.

**What we're saying here is the limit as loud as my voice would go.**

So these are quite literal and easy to understand.

But then we get expressions which I think most of you will have heard

at some time and are perhaps a little more confusing.

So, <code>夏はアイスクリイムに**限る**</code> -- now, loosely in English that means

<code>In summer, ice cream **is the best thing**</code>.

![](media/image960.png)

What we're actually saying is  
<code>Speaking of summer, when it comes to summer, it **reaches its limit** at ice cream</code>,

in other words, ice cream **is the furthest you can take** summer /

ice cream **is the pinnacle of** summer /  
**there's nothing beyond** ice cream when we're talking about summer.

::: info
Of course, this is just a natural Eng translation, hence why it is hard to pin-point 限る here.
:::
---

And this can be used in all kinds of different expressions, for example:

<code>運動なら水泳に**限る**</code>  
(if it's exercise / if we're talking about exercise, it **reaches its limit** with swimming \[<code>水泳</code>\] /

swimming **is absolutely the best kind of** exercise).

![](media/image310.png)

And moving on from this we get expressions like <code>彼女に**限って**そんなことはしない</code>.

![](media/image465.png)

And again, in loose English this would be  
"She **of all people** wouldn't do such a thing

/ she'd be **the last person** to do such a thing".

What we're actually saying is

<code>She is **the very limit of** people who wouldn't do such a thing</code>.

---

So just like ice cream being **the best thing** in summer  
or calling **at the very maximum extent** of your voice,  
she is **the maximum, the extreme** of people who wouldn't do such a thing.

**Other people might possibly do it, even if you'd think they wouldn't,**

**but she is the very limit of the kind of person who wouldn't do that kind of thing.**

## 限る used negatively (not limited to x)

Now, **the concept of <code>限る</code> (limit) is often used negatively to show that**

**something is not limited to a particular statement, a particular notion.**

So, <code>辞書に書いてあることが常に正しいとは限らない</code>.

![](media/image406.png)

**And this <code>-とは限らない</code> essentially sums up the previous statement**

and says that's **not limited to being the case.**

So what we're saying here is <code>Things that are written in a dictionary are always correct</code> --

**that's the statement, then we quote that <code>-とは限らない</code>:**

<code>**It's not necessarily the case that** things written in a dictionary are always correct.</code>

And I think we found that out to be true on various occasions.

## 限り

Now, again, this <code>限り</code> can be used for the limits of one's knowledge and very often is,

so <code>私の知っている**限り**ではそんな言葉はない</code>.

![](media/image41.png)

So, in English we would say <code>As far as I know, there's no such word</code>,  
but the expression strategy here is to modify the noun <code>限り</code> -- <code>私の知っている**限り**</code>

(**the limit of** what I know): <code>**Up to the limit of** what I know, there is no such word.</code>

And actually in this case it's pretty similar to the English:

<code>**as far as** I know / **to the limit of** what I know</code>.

And it's interesting here that **while English says** <code>**as far as** I know</code>,

**Japanese achieves the same broad pattern by modifying the noun <code>限り</code> (limit).**

And as we talked about last week *(Lesson 90)*,  
**modification does an awful lot of the heavy lifting in Japanese**

**that's done by other strategies in English.**

---

Now, another common expression which can be a bit confusing is the kind of expression

we find in <code>急いでいる時に**限って**バスが遅れる</code>

(**limited to** times when we are in a hurry, the bus comes late).

![](media/image392.png)

Now, **this is obviously not literal, but it expresses a sentiment often felt,**

**that the bus or whatever it is that does something we don't want it to do does it**

**specifically when we very much don't want or can't afford it to do it.**

So really that expression that can seem a little bit confusing at first is a very natural

kind of expression which I think you do find in English sometimes.

**It's only when we really need it that it doesn't happen.**

### その場限り

Now, another expression is <code>その場限り</code>.

So, <code>その場限りことを言う</code> means  
she says things **on the spur of the moment** / she talks right off the top of her head.

![](media/image53.png)

**<code>その場</code>**, which we've discussed in another video, which I'll link *(Lesson 75)*, means literally

**<code>that place / the appropriate place / the place one would happen to be at at the time</code>**, but

**of course in Japanese as in other languages, place can also mean a time or an occasion.**

---

So, <code>**その場限り**ことを言う</code> means  
she says things that **just arise out of the particular occasion and nothing else** --  
**limited to that particular occasion / having no real relevance outside that particular occasion.**

So the implication is just essentially talking stuff of no real value that

comes off the top of her head.

### その場限りさ

And a very common expression related to this is <code>喧嘩はその場限りさ</code> – ケンカ

and **this is a popular expression, it's not exactly a full sentence.**

![](media/image1025.png)

::: info
I used Kanji form for ケンカ (喧嘩), but both are fine.
:::
**The <code>さ</code> is rather making it into a <code>should</code>.**

**<code>さ</code> here is saying <code>that's how it ought to be / come on, that's how it should be</code>.**

And it's translated into English as <code>quarrels should not be continued</code>.

![](media/image597.png)

Sometimes it's even translated as <code>let not the sun settle on your wrath</code>,

which of course is nothing to do with what it's really saying.

**But the point here is that quarrels should be limited to <code>その場</code>**

**(the occasion, the event on which they arise).**

**So if you quarrel with someone today you shouldn't be carrying on that quarrel tomorrow.**

Very good advice.

So this is a range of the circumstances in which the <code>限り / 限る</code> concept

is applied in Japanese.

![](media/image482.png)

There are others, of course, but with this information

I think you'll be in a better position to see what's going on.
