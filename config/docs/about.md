# Intro

First and foremost, this project only exists because Mordraug and Nunko spent a lot of time transcribing all of Cure Dolly's videos and sharing them in [this Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpuXerkGU8waJ4DPDNJA4bGeqOvM-csXjTe57iHARHc/). Many thanks to them!

For my part, [I (Kellen)](https://bento.me/kln) converted script to Markdown, changed the formatting slightly, and published it using Vitepress, which I find more convenient than Google Docs or PDF.

## What's changed

1. Changed the <u>underlined text</u> to **bold** due to personal preference.
2. All text in "quotes" became `highlighted` in color
3. Changed note type from *italic text* to spe—Åial containers

::: info
Example of new note
:::

::: tip
Rarely, there are also containers like this
:::

::: details And something like his (Click)
Badoom
:::

4. I have added a very rough and imprecise grouping of lessons. This was only done to allow the list to be collapsed.
5. WIP merge line-by-line text into paragraph text

Something else may have broken during all the changes, but there shouldn't be any critical breaks.
