こんにちは。

Today we're going to talk about a word that has

a whole long list of definitions in the dictionary,

many of which seem to have nothing to do with each other.

I won't even go into this list.

We'll just tackle the word and what it really means and see how it

comes to have so many other extended meanings.

**The word is <code>うち</code> and it's one of the words you learn early on in Japanese.**

![](media/image870.png)

**Probably the first context in which you learn it is that it is**

**an alternative way of pronouncing this kanji** *(家)*.

**It can be <code>いえ</code> but it can also be <code>うち</code>, and both of them mean <code>house</code>.**

**This is the only way we can use this kanji.**

---

**The other <code>うち</code> is this one - 内,**

**and I don't think we should really regard them as different words, because**

**it's a native Japanese word that had the Chinese kanji imposed at a later date**

**and, as is often the case, the kanji helps a little bit to differentiate exactly what we mean.**

But only a little bit here.

---

So, **when <code>うち</code> means <code>house</code> *(家)*,**

**the difference between <code>いえ</code> and <code>うち</code>**

**is that <code>いえ</code> refers to the physical building, the actual house.**

**<code>うち</code> refers to what you might call the spiritual interior of the house:**

**the family, the life that takes place in the house.**

To a small extent we can say that it's somewhat similar to the difference

in English between the words <code>house</code> and <code>home</code>.

**If we say that we're visiting someone's house,**

**we usually say <code>うち</code> because it is <code>house</code> in the sense of their family, their home.**

**That's what we're visiting. We're not visiting the physical building.**

And just as a little sidenote,

**you might sometimes encounter expressions like <code>さくらんち</code>.**

**This is a very common abbreviation for <code>さくらのうち</code>.**

![](media/image192.png)

**So this really actually gives us the basis for all the other meanings of <code>うち</code>,**

whichever kanji it's written with:

**this notion of a spiritual interior, an enclosure, defined, as it were, by its contents.**

## うち as meaning <code>me</code> / 私 etc.

Now, the next time you encounter <code>うち</code> may well be

when you encounter, in anime or something, a girl who's **using Kansai-ben**,

**and typically she will say <code>うち</code> instead of <code>私</code>.**

![](media/image309.png)

**So <code>うち</code> can mean <code>me</code>, particularly feminine,**

**particularly the Kansai dialect, although it's not restricted to that.**

---

**And this is very interesting because it's rather similar to when**

**<code>こちら</code> is used to mean <code>me</code>;**

**again, what <code>こちら</code> means is <code>this side (the side that includes me)</code>.**

And this really has to be understood

in the light of the fact that

**the distinction between the individual and the family or group to which an individual belongs**

**is much less marked in Japanese than in Western culture**

**and in the past was even less marked than it is now.**

---

**When Japanese people talk about,**

**say, <code>my little sister</code>, generally speaking they won't say <code>僕の妹</code> or <code>私の妹</code>.**

They would tend to say <code>**うち**の妹</code>

(the little sister of **our house** / the little sister of **our family** / the little sister of **our group**).

![](media/image715.png)

And even <code>**うち**のきょう</code>, which is

<code>the religion of **our house**, **our family**, **our group**</code>,

**because religion is still to a large extent regarded in Japanese as something inherited, something part of one's family group,**

**rather than an individual decision or commitment.**

## うち vs そと

**Now, from this we get a very fundamental distinction in Japanese,**

**which is between the concepts of <code>うち / 内</code> and <code>そと / 外</code>.**

**<code>うち</code> refers to the group one belongs to, the in-group;**

**<code>そと</code> refers to everything outside that group.**

![](media/image849.png)

And this has wide-ranging implications for Japanese culture

and also for the Japanese language.

---

**For example, words like <code>くれる</code> and <code>あげる</code>, which are generally**

**explained to mean giving something up from oneself or**

**receiving something down to oneself,**

**is not strictly limited to the self.**

---

**It's actually referring to the <code>うち</code>, which could**

**be oneself but could also be the group to which one belongs.**

**So, when we talk about someone <code>くれる</code>-ing to one's sister or one's friend**

**this is because we regard the sister or the friend as part of our <code>うち</code>,**

therefore it's giving down to <code>us</code>.

**And you'll sometimes see <code>くれる</code> used even where**

**there is no strict connection between the speaker and the person receiving,**

**but if the speaker is identifying with that person, regarding them at this point**

**at least as more <code>うち</code> than <code>そと</code> then <code>くれる</code> is appropriate.**

---

So we can see that this whole concept of <code>うち / そと</code>,

which has wide-ranging cultural implications which I won't go into,

also has implications for the grammatical structures we use.

## うち used to define a group that x is a part of 

Now, developing from this,

**<code>うち</code> can be used to define a group of which anything is a part.**

So we can say <code>多くの**うち**から選ぶ</code>,

which means <code>choose from a large number</code> or, strictly speaking,

<code>choose from **a group consisting** of a large number</code>.

![](media/image763.png)

**So <code>うち</code> here refers to the group from which one's choosing.**

---

**And it can become a little more abstract than that.**

**It can be referring to an <code>うち</code> of time, an enclosure of time,**

**and again, an enclosure defined by its contents.**

So, we might say <code>温かい**うち**に食べる</code>, which means <code>eat it **while** it's warm</code>.

<code>Eat it **while** it's hot</code>, as we'd say in English.

<code>**温かいうち**</code> is that <code>うち</code>, **that enclosure, that period, during which the food is warm.**

So **it's an enclosure defined by its contents, like the other kinds of <code>うち</code>.**

**When does the <code>うち</code> end? It ends when the food stops being warm.**

![](media/image991.png)

![](media/image397.png)

Similarly, <code>若い**うち**</code> (**while** one is young) --

one should do this, do that, **while** one is young.

**The <code>うち</code>, the enclosure of time, is defined by its contents.**

**While** one is young, one is in the <code>若い**うち**</code>.

**When one ceases to be young, that's where the limits of the enclosure lie.**

### 今のうち

And **this can extend to usages that can be a little confusing at first.**

So, for example, <code>**今のうち**</code>, which is a phrase you'll often hear in anime and such.

For example, when an enemy is disabled and now is the time to do the

magical purification, somebody might shout <code>**今のうち**!</code>

![](media/image524.png)

And what that means is literally

<code>**in the house of now** / **in the enclosure of now**</code>.

**It doesn't necessarily mean <code>this absolute instant</code>,**

**but it does mean <code>while now continues</code>.**

---

What does <code>now</code> mean in this case?

Well, **<code>now</code> means the situation as it is at present,**

in this case, **while** the villain is still purifiable,

**while** he's disabled, **while** we can actually do what we need to do.

It could mean, **while** we're still able to run away.

It could mean, **while** the Great Door still hasn't closed.

In other words, <code>**今のうち**</code> is

<code>**while the circumstances that prevail at the moment continue to prevail**</code>.

**Once they cease to prevail, you will no longer be <code>今のうち</code>.**

### そのうち

And another one that can seem confusing is <code>そのうち</code>.

![](media/image15.png)

Now, **<code>そのうち</code>** is translated as meaning, and does mean,

**<code>sooner or later / at some time in the future / it will eventually happen / by and by</code>.**

So why does <code>そのうち</code> mean that?

To understand this, we not only have to understand <code>うち</code>

but we have to understand a little bit more about <code>その</code>.

#### What does その mean

Now, I've made a video *(Lesson 75)* in which I explain

various things about the use of <code>その</code> in Japanese.

**It very often replaces what in English would be pronouns.**

So if we say <code>さくらと**その**犬</code>, we're **not** saying <code>Sakura and that dog</code>.

We're saying <code>Sakura and **her** dog</code>.

![](media/image1068.png)

**<code>その</code> often implies something related to what we're talking about.**

**And it's one of the strategies that's used**

**in view of the fact that Japanese doesn't use pronouns all that often.**

---

A somewhat more abstract usage is, for example,

in a dictionary definition like <code>**立ち会う**</code>, which means

<code>**be in a place as a witness**</code>, and the Japanese definition is

<code>証人として**その**場に出る</code> which means

<code>as a witness, appear in **that** place, come out in **that** place</code>.

**But what does <code>that place</code> mean in this situation?**

**What is <code>その</code> actually being used to mean?**

**It means simply whatever place it is, the place appropriate to the current situation.**

#### So, what does そのうち mean?

And **this is the kind of <code>その</code> that's being used in <code>そのうち</code>.**

**<code>そのうち</code> means during the enclosure of time that is appropriate**

**to whatever we're talking about (it will happen).**

![](media/image305.png)

**<code>そのうち</code> means it will happen within a period of time**

**that's reasonable for it to happen in,**

which may seem a little vague, but it's no vaguer than the equivalent English expressions

like <code>one of these days / sooner or later / before long</code>.

**It's a little bit more specific in that it does tend to imply**

**a time that's not too late for it to be of any use.**

So this is really how <code>うち</code> extends its meaning from quite specific ones

to more and more abstract ones, all of which are closely related to the fundamental meaning.
