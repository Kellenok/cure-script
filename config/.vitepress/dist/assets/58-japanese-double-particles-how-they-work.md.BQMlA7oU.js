How they really work | lesson 58: Particle Combinations</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about <code>combined particles</code> or <code>double particles</code></p><p>or whatever silly names the textbooks and Japanese grammar sites call them by.</p><p>And I&#39;ll explain in just a moment why I&#39;m calling them <code>silly</code>.</p><p>What I&#39;m referring to is particles in combinations</p><p>like <code>には</code>, <code>にも</code>, <code>-とは</code>, <code>のが</code> etc.</p><p>And if you look at the sites you&#39;ll find lots of rules like</p><p><code>you can use に with は and も, but you can&#39;t use it with が or で</code>;</p><p><code>you can use -と with this, but not that</code>, and so on.</p><p>And you don&#39;t need to learn any of these rules.</p><p>If you understand what&#39;s going on and why it&#39;s happening,</p><p>it all makes complete logical sense.</p><p>There are no random rules happening here, just straightforward logic.</p><p>The reason it gets so confusing in English-language so-called Japanese grammar</p><p>is because they&#39;re not just giving the wrong answers.</p><p>They&#39;re giving the wrong answers to the wrong questions.</p><p>They&#39;re posing questions that should never have been posed in the first place.</p><p><strong>There&#39;s really no such thing as a <code>double particle</code> or a <code>combined particle</code>.</strong></p><p>What&#39;s happening all the time is that<br> the particles are just doing their job the way they always do.</p><p>So what about all these random rules</p><p>about when they can do it and when they can&#39;t?</p><p>Well, all these are actually based on what the particles are and what they actually do.</p><p>So, the first distinction to make, that the textbooks and websites never make,</p><p>is the distinction between logical and non-logical particles. This is absolutely crucial.</p><h2 id="logical-non-logical-particles" tabindex="-1">Logical &amp; non-logical particles <a class="header-anchor" href="#logical-non-logical-particles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Logical &amp; non-logical particles&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, let&#39;s start by looking at the five main logical particles.</p><p>These are the particles that tell us what&#39;s going on in the sentence.</p><p>They mark each noun with the role it plays in the sentence, whether it&#39;s the person doing something, the thing that&#39;s being done, the thing it&#39;s being done to, the place where it&#39;s being done, etc. etc.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, the first obvious thing to understand is that you can&#39;t combine</p><p>any of these five logical particles with any of the others.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>Because of what they do.</p><p>They mark each noun with its function in the sentence.</p><p>A noun can&#39;t actually be more than one part of speech at the same time,</p><p>so it would just make no sense at all<br> to combine any of these five together with each other.</p><hr><p>But what you can combine them with is non-logical particles,</p><p>notably the two non-logical topic markers, は and も.</p><p>You can combine these because they don&#39;t clash logically.</p><p>は and も don&#39;t tell us anything about what a noun is doing in the sentence.</p><p>It&#39;s only ever marking that thing as a topic, either to make it the topic of the sentence</p><p>or to make it a sub-topic for strategic reasons, which we&#39;ll talk about in a moment.</p><h2 id="primary-secondary-particles" tabindex="-1">Primary &amp; secondary particles <a class="header-anchor" href="#primary-secondary-particles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Primary &amp; secondary particles&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, the next thing to know is that the two primary particles,</p><p>or the primary and secondary particle, that is,</p><p><strong>が and を, don&#39;t combine with non-logical particles.</strong></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Why don&#39;t they?</p><p>Well, が is the primary particle:</p><p>it has to be in every sentence of every kind;</p><p>を is the secondary particle: it marks the direct object.</p><p>This means that in any sentence that is directly transitive,</p><p>を has to be present, whether we can see it or not.</p><hr><p>Now, what do I mean by directly transitive?</p><p>All the textbooks and the dictionaries confuse transitivity</p><p>with Japanese self-move and other-move verbs.</p><p>And in a way this is understandable,</p><p>because there&#39;s a large overlap between the two.</p><p><strong>But they aren&#39;t the same thing.</strong></p><p>So let&#39;s look here at what we mean by actual transitivity.</p><p>If I say <code>I walk</code>, <code>I sing</code>, <code>I eat</code>, those are all intransitive because I&#39;m doing the verb</p><p>and I&#39;m not doing it to anything else.</p><p>It has no direct object.</p><p>If I say <code>I sing a song</code> or <code>I read a book</code> or <code>I eat bread</code>,</p><p>then this is transitive because the verb has a direct object.</p><p>Now, when I say <code>directly transitive</code>,<br> what I mean is verbs that are done directly to an object.</p><p>So, for example, I can say <code>I talk to Sakura</code></p><p>but in English, as you see, we have to have a preposition there.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We&#39;re not saying <code>I talk Sakura</code>, so we&#39;re not directly transitive,</p><p>we&#39;re indirectly transitive through the medium of a preposition.</p><p>Now, Japanese has the same distinction.</p><p>We <strong>don&#39;t</strong> say <code>さくらを話す</code>,</p><p>which would be the equivalent in English of <code>I talk Sakura</code>.</p><p>We say <code>さくらと話す</code> or <code>さくらに話す</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, please don&#39;t run away from this with the idea that</p><p>particles like に and -と are the same as English prepositions.</p><p>They&#39;re not.</p><p>If you&#39;re going to compare them to anything in European languages,</p><p>you have to compare all the logical particles</p><p>to the German or Latin case structures.</p><p>You may not know what those are and you don&#39;t need to,</p><p>because I model these in ways that don&#39;t require</p><p>knowledge of European grammar.</p><p>But the point here is that they&#39;re not prepositions,</p><p>but for our purposes here we can say that they&#39;re used under the same circumstances</p><p>that prepositions get used in English.</p><p>So if we say <code>I eat bread</code>, that&#39;s directly transitive.</p><p>If we say <code>I talk to Sakura</code>, that&#39;s indirectly transitive.</p><p>In Japanese, if we use the を particle, it&#39;s directly transitive.</p><p>If we use another particle, like -と or に, it&#39;s indirectly transitive.</p><p>In some cases English and Japanese will disagree</p><p>about what is directly transitive and what&#39;s indirectly transitive,</p><p>but an awful lot of the time they&#39;re in fact in agreement</p><p>because these are fairly basic factors of human communication.</p><hr><p>Now, the point here is that these two direct particles --</p><p>if we say <code>I hit Sakura</code> there are no prepositions anywhere. This is completely direct.</p><p>I do the hitting and I&#39;m hitting something, I&#39;m hitting Sakura.</p><p>I&#39;m not hitting to Sakura or hitting at Sakura or hitting by Sakura.</p><p>I&#39;m directly hitting Sakura.</p><p>Now, because of the directness of these two particles</p><p>they can&#39;t have a non-logical particle appended to them.</p><p>So, if you want to use a non-logical particle here, you can do it.</p><p>But the way you do it is always by simply attaching the non-logical particle</p><p><strong>and leaving the logical particle out</strong>.</p><p>And because these are so fundamental to every sentence,</p><p>they can be understood by the hearer in Japanese.</p><p>So, if we say <code>さくらはなぐった</code>-- <code>I hit Sakura</code> --</p><p>this means <code><em>(zeroが)</em> さくらは<strong>zeroを</strong>なぐった</code>,</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>but we don&#39;t say <code>さくらはをなぐった</code> or <code>さくらをはなぐった</code>.</strong></p><p>Because you can&#39;t put anything between these two direct fundamental logical particles</p><p>and the thing they directly connect to.</p><p>So now we understand the basis for practically all</p><p>the strange rules that you&#39;re going to hear about.</p><p>You just need to remember these two facts:</p><p><strong>you can&#39;t pair one of these main five logical particles with any of the other four</strong></p><p>and<br><strong>you can&#39;t put a non-logical particle before or after the two primary particles が and を.</strong></p><p>Now, once we know that, what have we got left and how does it work?</p><p>We can pair non-logical particles with any of the remaining logical particles.</p><p>And the reason we&#39;re doing this is not to make</p><p>some kind of weird, unusual pair-combination.</p><p>We&#39;re simply using the functions of both at the same time.</p><p>So the most straightforward thing we do here is simply make something into a topic.</p><p>If we say <code><em>(zeroが)</em> 冬には雪だるまを作る</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>In the winter we make a snowman.</code></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, we could say <code><em>(zeroが)</em> 冬に雪だるまを作る</code>.</p><p><strong>We don&#39;t have to have the は there.</strong></p><p>So why would we choose sometimes to have a は there?</p><p>Well, in this case we&#39;re making it the topic of the sentence.</p><p>We&#39;re saying <code>here&#39;s winter/speaking of winter, this is what we do.</code></p><p>And it also plays the other roles that は always plays<br> as an extension of its topic-making nature.</p><p>And I&#39;ve done <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l_ZlQQU4ZE&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>a video</strong></a> on these multiple uses of は,</p><p>so if you&#39;re not familiar with this, please take a look at it,</p><p>because it&#39;s rather important for understanding what&#39;s going on here.</p><p>So, we&#39;re making a topic out of the winter and</p><p>we&#39;re also differentiating winter from other seasons.</p><p>We&#39;re saying <code>冬には</code> --<br><code>As for winter, as opposed to the other seasons, we make a snowman.</code></p><p>Now, if the person you were talking to was someone</p><p>from a very, very cold place, they might say</p><p><code><em>(zeroが)</em> 春にも雪だるまを作る</code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what they&#39;re saying is <code>We make a snowman in the spring as well.</code></p><p>So we can use the exclusive particle は or the inclusive particle も.</p><p>And both of them add that degree of meaning.</p><p>Now why do we have the に here?</p><p>Because we actually need the に.</p><p><strong>We need the に to mark the fact that we&#39;re doing an activity at a particular time.</strong></p><p>This is the logical function of に.</p><p>And having done that, we can also make a topic out of it.</p><p>And that&#39;s simply what we&#39;re doing here.</p><p>In other cases we might say <code>明日学校に行く</code></p><p>and that simply means I&#39;m going to school.</p><p>If we say <code>明日学校には行く</code>, the implication is that we&#39;re going to school but we&#39;re not going somewhere else that they thought we might be going.</p><p>If we say <code>明日学校にも行く</code>, we&#39;re saying I&#39;m going to school as well as somewhere else that you already know about.</p><p>So you see, in each of these cases our non-logical particle</p><p>is simply adding meaning to the logical particle that&#39;s already there.</p><p>They don&#39;t clash, because one is logical and the other is non-logical,</p><p>so they&#39;re not telling us conflicting information.<br><strong>They&#39;re telling us complementary information.</strong></p><p>And that&#39;s why you can use them that way and why</p><p>you can&#39;t combine one logical particle with another logical particle</p><p>or one non-logical particle with another non-logical particle.</p><hr><p>Now, there are other particles that can pair with other particles,</p><p>but again, this whole pairing concept is the wrong way of looking at it.</p><p>As always the particles are simply doing what they do.</p><p>For example, the の particle, if it&#39;s the nominalizing の,</p><p>the の that turns something into a noun,</p><p>so, for example, <code>泳ぐの</code> is <code>swimming</code>,</p><p><strong>the noun</strong> <code>swimming</code>, the activity called <code>swimming</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We can say <code>泳ぐのが好きです</code>.</p><p>We can say <code>泳ぐのをします</code>.</p><p><strong>You can combine any logical particle with の because that kind of の turns the thing before it into what is effectively a noun, and a noun can take any of the logical particles.</strong></p><p>It could be a longer logical clause:</p><p><code>さくらと一緒に泳ぐのが好きだ</code> --</p><p><code>I like swimming together with Sakura</code>. / <strong>Sakura together with swimming pleasing is.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>gave a bit more literal translation just in case, 好き is an adjectival noun. Go by Dolly tho.</p></div><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>But the point is that once you&#39;ve put that nominalizing の onto the end of it,</p><p><strong>when it&#39;s the の that turns something into a noun, you then treat it as a noun</strong>.</p><p>And what do you do with a noun?</p><p>You put a logical particle onto it, don&#39;t you?</p><p>So, this is simple logic.</p><p>If you have any questions or comments, please put them in the Comments below</p><p>and I will answer as usual.</p><p>I&#39;d like to thank my Gold Kokeshi patrons,</p><p>and all my patrons and supporters on Patreon and everywhere.</p>',195),y=[m];function w(b,f,k,v,I,_){return a(),t("div",null,y)}const W=e(u,[["render",w]]);export{T as __pageData,W as default};
