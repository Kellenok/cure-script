Just one thing.</p><p>But also because the Eihongo Japanese model is so confusing</p><p>and so wedded to the myth of so-called <code>Japanese conjugation</code>, which doesn&#39;t exist,</p><p>that it makes that one eccentricity of <code>です</code> look like more than one.</p><hr><p>It looks as if it&#39;s all over the place when in fact it&#39;s only got one eccentricity --</p><p>which is a little bit confusing, but when you see it for what it is, it&#39;s just that one thing.</p><p>So, how important is it that we misunderstand the <code>だ</code> copula?</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s not central to every Japanese sentence the way the が-particle is, so is it that bad?</p><p>Well, as a matter of fact it is, because it takes away</p><p>another of the absolute pillars of understanding Japanese structure.</p><p>And that is, understanding the three engines and the three core sentences.</p><hr><p>There are only three ways a logical Japanese sentence can end:</p><p>with a verb, an adjective, or a noun + copula.</p><p>It can&#39;t end with a noun on its own; it can only end with a noun + copula.</p><p>And this is fundamentally important and we&#39;ll get to why in just a moment,</p><p>but I&#39;ll just note here that part of the reasoning behind Tae Kim saying that the copula is a mere declarative</p><p>-- it doesn&#39;t actually do anything logical and grammatical, it just emphasizes what we have to say -- is because in <strong>casual</strong> speech <code>だ</code> sometimes gets dropped.</p><p>Now, the important thing to understand here is that <strong>this does not mean that it&#39;s unnecessary</strong>.</p><p>In English we often say things like <code>Got up early this morning</code>, <code>Fancy a cup of coffee?</code>,</p><p><code>Call that a rabbit? Looks more like a teddy bear in a rabbit suit to me!</code></p><p>And in all these cases we know, everybody knows, that the sentences aren&#39;t fully grammatical.</p><p>You have to say, <code>I got up early this morning</code>, <code>Do you fancy a cup of coffee?</code>,</p><p><code>Do you call that a rabbit? It looks more like a teddy bear in a rabbit suit to me!</code></p><p>This is perfectly natural. All languages drop necessary grammatical elements</p><p>when they can be readily understood by the [listener] in very casual speech.</p><p>You can&#39;t do it in an essay or in formal writing or in a legal document</p><p>or anything like that, but you can do it in casual speech.</p><hr><p>In Japanese, not only does the copula get dropped,</p><p><strong>half the particles can get dropped in very casual speech</strong>.</p><p>And I don&#39;t think anybody argues that they aren&#39;t necessary.</p><p>So, <strong>in actual grammatical Japanese</strong> you can only end a sentence in one of those three ways.</p><p>It can end with a verb, it can end with an adjective, or it can end with the copula,</p><p>and <strong>the copula always has to be attached to a noun</strong>, because that&#39;s how the copula works.</p><p>And as we know, what the copula does is tell us that A is B.</p><p><code>さくらが日本人<strong>だ</strong></code> means <code>Sakura <strong>is</strong> a Japanese person</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It only works one way around.</p><p>A Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura.</p><p>Sakura is a Japanese person.</p><p>That&#39;s what we&#39;re being told by a copula sentence.</p><hr><p>Now, if we look at all the elements in Japanese, all the verbal elements, there aren&#39;t very many.</p><p>Unlike English, unlike European languages, there really are very few.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>There are verbs, adjectives and the copula, and then, aside from that, we have nouns --</p><p>-- nearly everything that&#39;s not a verb or an adjective is a noun.</p><p>There are also particles, and there are some conjunctions like <code>なら</code> and <code>けれど</code>.</p><p>Almost everything else that isn&#39;t a verb or an adjective is in fact a noun.</p><p>There are a few exceptions but not very many.</p><p>Now, why are we dividing them up in this way?</p><p>On the one side we have verbs, adjectives and the copula;</p><p>on the other side we have nouns, particles and conjunctions.</p><p>The reason is that when we split them up this way,</p><p>apart from the fact that we have the three engines together,</p><p>the three engines have another characteristic, another quality.</p><p>They are all <code>用言</code>, they are all transforming verbal elements,</p><p>that&#39;s to say, they can all change grammatically.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Dolly does not give the Kanji form of 「ようげん」but I am practically sure it is this one.</p></div><p>They don&#39;t change as much as conventional Japanese or Tae Kim-sensei</p><p>would have us believe. They don&#39;t conjugate.</p><p>But <strong>they do change the last kana</strong> (in a couple of cases a little more than the last kana)</p><p>and then, in the case of verbs and adjectives,</p><p><strong>they can attach helper verbs, helper adjectives, and helper nouns</strong>.</p><p>And this is a fundamental basis of the way Japanese works.</p><p>In the other column we have nouns, particles and conjunctions, and these never change.</p><p><strong>A noun never changes grammatically</strong>.</p><p>It never has any kind of transformation or modification made for grammatical purposes.</p><p><strong>Particles never change</strong>. They attach to nouns but they always stay the same.</p><p>Conjunctions, like <code>から</code> and <code>けれど</code>, don&#39;t change their form for grammatical purposes.</p><p>The only verbal elements that do that in Japanese are the three engines:</p><p>verbs, adjectives and the copula.</p><p>But if you look at the conventional Japanese grammar textbooks and websites</p><p>you don&#39;t end up knowing, for the most part,</p><p>that <strong>the copula is one of these grammatically transforming elements</strong>.</p><p>We know that the verbs are. We know that the adjectives are.</p><p>We know that <code>だ</code> can actually move into the past tense and become <code>だった</code>,</p><p>but we don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s a fully, slightly limited, but a modulating element.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The fact that we know that it has one modulation just makes the whole thing more confusing.</p><p>It looks like an oddity. But it isn&#39;t an oddity.</p><p><strong>Just like verbs and adjectives, the copula is a fully transforming element.</strong></p><p><strong>It has a て-form</strong>, just like verbs and adjectives. <strong>And that て-form is <code>で</code></strong>,</p><p>and <strong>it&#39;s the same て-form whether it&#39;s the <code>だ</code> version or the <code>です</code> version</strong>.</p><p><strong>And it has a connective form</strong> <em>(な)</em>, which is used when it&#39;s going before the noun it modifies</p><p>rather than after the noun it modifies.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We can say, <code>女の子は綺麗<strong>だ</strong></code> (the girl <strong>is</strong> pretty), or we can say <code>綺麗<strong>な</strong>女の子</code>.</p><p>And when we turn it around this way, the <code>だ</code> has become <code>な</code>.</p><p><strong>If we want to chain two adjectival nouns together, we use the て-form of the copula.</strong></p><p>And this is just the same as what we do with adjectives.</p><p>If we want to say <code>Sakura is small and pretty</code>, we say <code>さくらが小さくて綺麗だ</code>.</p><p>If we want to say, <code>Sakura is pretty and small</code> (pretty, <code>綺麗</code>, is a noun, an adjectival noun --</p><p>we know it&#39;s a noun because it can be written with all kanji</p><p>and anything that&#39;s written with two or more kanji</p><p>and almost everything that&#39;s written with one kanji is always a noun),</p><p>we say <code>さくらが綺麗<strong>で</strong>小さい</code>.</p><p>If we want to say <code>Sakura is genki</code>, we say <code>さくらが元気だ</code>.</p><p>If we want to say <code>Sakura is genki and pretty</code>, we say <code>さくらが元気<strong>で</strong>綺麗だ</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>I guess that since copula attaches to a noun, it is why we have both て-form of the copula 「で」after 元気 &amp; also the regular copula form だ at the end after 綺麗. So basically 2 copulas but one of them is also chaining the nouns together. But just my guess, so take it with a salt.</p></div><p>And you see we&#39;ve done exactly what we do with adjectives.</p><p><strong>With adjectives</strong>, if we want to chain two adjectives together,</p><p>we put the first one into the て-form: <code>さくらが小さく<strong>て</strong>かわいい.</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>If I understand correctly, the て is the adjectival joining copula form like で, and the last い in かわいい is the plain copula form of the adjective as given in lesson 6.</p></div><hr><p>If we want to chain <strong>two adjectival nouns</strong> with their attached copula together,</p><p><strong>we turn the first copula into its て-form</strong>, which is <code>で</code>.</p><p>Now, for some reason the textbooks never explain this.</p><p>They try to tell us that adjectival nouns are some weird thing called a <code>な-adjective</code></p><p>that has this thing called <code>な</code> stuck onto it for no reason that we can possibly understand,</p><p>even though when it comes at the end of a sentence it has <code>だ</code> like any other noun.</p><p>And then, when we want to chain two together, most people, I think, seriously believe</p><p>that the で-particle, for no possible explicable reason, is used for this purpose.</p><p>Of course, <strong>it&#39;s not the で-particle</strong>; <strong>it&#39;s the て-form of the copula <code>だ</code> or <code>です</code></strong>.</p><p>And I think it&#39;s the fact that this is never explained that allows Tae Kim-sensei</p><p>to believe that <code>だ</code> is simply a declarative.</p><p>If it was a declarative, why would it need a て-form?</p><p>Why would you need a て-form on what&#39;s essentially just a verbal exclamation mark?</p><p>Why would you need a soft connective form on what&#39;s essentially just a verbal exclamation mark?</p><p>You wouldn&#39;t.</p><p>But because conventional Eihongo Japanese never makes it clear to us</p><p>that this is what&#39;s actually happening, that <strong><code>な</code> is the pre-connective form of <code>だ</code></strong>,</p><p>that <strong><code>で</code> in these cases is the て-form of <code>だ</code> the copula</strong>, because it never explains that,</p><p>it makes it possible for even someone as intelligent as Tae Kim-sensei</p><p>to misconceive what <code>だ</code> actually is and what it actually does.</p><p>And having done that, we&#39;ve really lost our grasp of</p><p>the three fundamental engines of every Japanese sentence.</p><p>And I should say that <strong><code>だ</code> and <code>です</code> aren&#39;t in fact the only two forms of the copula</strong> in modern Japanese.</p><p>They&#39;re the most common forms, but <strong>there are also two others.</strong></p><h2 id="である-copula-form" tabindex="-1">である copula form <a class="header-anchor" href="#である-copula-form" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;である copula form&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Sometimes we use <code>である</code>, which is a bit of a fossil.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>It&#39;s an old form of the copula</strong> and it&#39;s <strong>used in formal but not necessarily polite contexts.</strong></p><p>So it can be used for example in newspaper reporting</p><p>where it&#39;s just being formal and objective, not particularly polite.</p><p>The famous novel <code>I Am a Cat</code> is, in Japanese, <code>我輩は猫である</code>,</p><p>and the reason it uses <code>我輩</code> for <code>I</code> and <code>である</code> for the copula conveys in Japanese,</p><p>in a way that the English translation can&#39;t convey, the character of the cat in question,</p><p>who has the personality of a rather <code>偉そう</code>, a rather self-important gentleman</p><p>who refers to himself as <code>我輩</code> and uses the rather archaic and formal</p><p>but not particularly polite copula <code>である</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>わがはい has two forms - 我輩 and 吾輩, they are basically identical, but apparently,<br><a href="https://chigai-hikaku.com/?p=49060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>it seems that 吾輩 is a bit less pompous/restrained and 吾 is not a 常用漢字.</strong></a></p></div><h2 id="でございます-copula-form" tabindex="-1">でございます copula form <a class="header-anchor" href="#でございます-copula-form" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;でございます copula form&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The other copula that we&#39;ll hear often is <code>でございます</code>, and <strong>that&#39;s ultra-polite</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>It&#39;s 敬語</strong>, and you&#39;ll have this used to you in Japanese hotels and places like that.</p><p><strong>All of them are forms of the copula</strong>,<br> and <strong>all of them have the same て-form, <code>で</code></strong>, <strong>and the same connective form, <code>な</code></strong>.</p><h2 id="です-ます-eccentricity" tabindex="-1">です &amp;
