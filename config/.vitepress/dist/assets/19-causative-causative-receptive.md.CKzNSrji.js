It&#39;s logical and super easy</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。<br> Today we are going to talk about the causative helper verb.</p><p>In the standard grammars this is called <code>causative</code> and it&#39;s a perfectly good name because <strong>it indicates that we are causing someone to do the verb to which it is attached.</strong></p><p>In the standard grammars <strong>it&#39;s often taught along with the receptive</strong></p><p>(which they like to call the <code>passive</code>) and there&#39;s a very very good reason for doing this although the real reason is never actually explained in the regular textbooks. So, I&#39;ll be telling you that shortly.</p><p>But first of all let&#39;s look at what the causative helper verb is.</p><p>It&#39;s a helper verb which, like the receptive, goes onto the end of the あ-stem of another verb, and while the receptive helper is <code>れる/</code>られる<code></code>, <strong>the causative helper is <code>せる/させる</code></strong>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If they sound rather close to each other, there&#39;s a good reason for that.</p><p>As we have noted earlier, the Eve and Adam of Japanese verbs are</p><p><code>ある</code> and <code>する</code> – <code>be</code> and <code>do</code>.</p><p><code>ある</code> is the mother of all self-move verbs; <code>する</code> is the father of all other-move verbs.</p><p>Now, <strong>the receptive <code>れる/</code>られる<code></code> is closely related to <code>ある</code>;</strong></p><p><strong>the causative <code>せる/させる</code> is closely related to <code>する</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And while it&#39;s not exact to say that they are the self-move and other-move versions</p><p>of each other, we can see that they are very closely related conceptually to that.</p><hr><p><strong><code>れる/</code>られる<code></code> indicates receiving the action to which it is attached.</strong></p><p><strong><code>せる/させる</code> means causing that action to be performed by somebody else.</strong></p><p>And this leads on to the most fundamental similarity between the two pairs of helper verbs –</p><p>the similarity that the textbooks never explain and that is most fundamental to understanding how they work.</p><p>Why don&#39;t the textbooks explain it?</p><p>Well, the fundamental reason is that they call the causative and the receptive helper verbs <code>conjugations</code>.</p><p>And the real structure of how they work is completely destroyed and obscured by calling them <code>conjugations</code>.</p><p><strong>A conjugated verb is by definition a single verb.</strong></p><p><strong>But a verb plus the receptive or the causative helper is never a single verb.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s two verbs.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Not only is it two verbs, but the two verbs always have two separate subjects.</strong></p><p>So in a sentence like <code><strong>水が</strong>犬に飲ま<strong>れた</strong></code> – <code><strong>the water</strong> <strong>got</strong> drunk by the dog</code></p><p>– we have <strong>two verbs, two actions, and two different actors doing the two different verbs.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>The main verb of the sentence, the core verb, is <code>れる</code> – <code>get</code></strong></p><p>– and <strong>that&#39;s being done by the water: the water is getting</strong> drunk by the dog.</p><p><strong>The secondary verb is <code>drink</code> and that&#39;s being done by the dog.</strong></p><p>This becomes clearer in a slightly longer sentence:</p><p><code><strong>さくらが</strong>だれかにかばんをぬすま<strong>れた</strong></code> – <code><strong>Sakura</strong> <strong>got</strong> her bag stolen by someone</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Again, <strong>there are two actions going on, and always in a receptive sentence the main action, the core action of the sentence, is <code>れる</code> – <code>receive</code>: <code>Sakura received</code>.</strong></p><hr><p>But there is a nested action within this done by the secondary verb, <code>ぬすむ</code> – <code>steal</code>.</p><p>And that&#39;s done by <code>someone</code>.</p><p>Now, it&#39;s exactly the same with the causative.</p><p><strong>We always have two actors performing the two different verbs.</strong></p><p>So if we say, <code><em>(zeroが)</em> 犬を食べ<strong>させた</strong></code>, which means <code><strong>I caused</strong> the dog to eat</code>,</p><p>there are <strong>two actions going on.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>There is the action of eating, which is being done by the dog, <strong>and then there is the main action, the core action of the sentence, the action of causing, which is done by me.</strong></p><p>So as you see, we cannot possibly talk about a conjugated verb in the case of either the</p><p>receptive or the causative helper.</p><p><strong>In each case, there are two separate verbs.</strong></p><p><strong>Even though they&#39;re joined together, they not only remain separate in function but</strong></p><p><strong>they refer to two different actors.</strong></p><p>Now let&#39;s also take a moment to understand what <code>せる/させる</code> actually means.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We&#39;re told that in English it can mean either <code>make</code> someone do something or</p><p><code>allow</code> someone to do something.</p><p>And that&#39;s correct: it can have either of those meanings.</p><p><strong>But the important thing to understand is that it can have either of those meanings but</strong></p><p><strong>it can also have neither of those meanings.</strong></p><p><strong>The best way to translate it is with the very un-English sounding <code>cause</code> someone to do something.</strong></p><p>Why?</p><p>Because we can mean that we&#39;re forcing them to do something, we can mean that we are allowing them to do something, but we can also mean something that isn&#39;t covered by either of those English translations.</p><p>An example?</p><p>Well, you&#39;ve already had one: <code><em>(zeroが)</em> 犬を食べさせた</code></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It doesn&#39;t mean <code>I forced the dog to eat</code>, does it?</p><p>But it also doesn&#39;t mean <code>I allowed the dog to eat</code>.</p><p><strong>It doesn&#39;t mean that I gave the dog permission to eat or I took it off its chain so it could reach the food.</strong></p><p>That&#39;s not what it means.</p><p><strong>It means that I set up the conditions under which it was able to eat; I gave it food;</strong></p><p><strong>I caused it to eat.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>So <code>せる/させる</code> means <code>cause</code> a person or a thing to perform an action by whatever means, whether that causing is allowing, whether it&#39;s compelling or whether it&#39;s setting up the conditions to make it happen.</strong></p><p>Now, the only thing that can appear to be a little confusing about the causative is</p><p>that <strong>sometimes the person or thing that we are causing to do something can be marked</strong></p><p><strong>by を and sometimes by に.</strong></p><p>Now, I&#39;ve told you before that Japanese particles do not change their function at random, as the textbooks strongly imply and sometimes openly state that they do –<br> and as we have to believe if we think that <code>コーヒーが好きだ</code> <em>(Coffee pleasing is)</em> literally means <code>I like coffee</code>.</p><p>And if you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about here, please watch the relevant video <em>(Lesson 9)</em>, because this is absolutely crucial to understanding Japanese correctly.</p><p>So how is it that two different logical particles can apply to the thing or person we are causing to do something?</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That is to say, the noun associated with <code>せる/させる</code>.</p><p><strong>First of all, we have to understand that this thing can be seen as either the object or the target of the action (<code>せる/させる</code>) of the person or thing that is doing the causing.</strong></p><p>If we take that object or target to be human, it becomes a little clearer.</p><p><strong>If we treat the person as the object, we are assuming that they have no personal will in the matter; we are treating them literally as an object.</strong></p><p>So this is more appropriate when we are compelling someone to do something;</p><p><strong>if we treat them as a target, the implication is more mutual, we are treating them more as an equal and this goes more naturally with allowing rather than compelling.</strong></p><p>And I&#39;ve talked about these degrees of mutuality between the particles を, に and と when</p><p>dealing with people <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVqs4TzqySw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>in a video which you may want to watch.</strong></a></p><p>However, the choice between に and を is not the main, or an exact, indicator of whether</p><p>we mean allowing or compelling when we use <code>せる/させる</code>.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>There are two reasons for this.</p><p>The first, as we&#39;ve already mentioned, is that saying that <code>せる/させる</code> either means</p><p><code>compel</code> or <code>allow</code> is warping the meaning of the causative by trying to find exact English analogies, and there is no precise English analogy.</p><p>On many occasions, as I demonstrated, it may mean neither <code>compel</code> nor <code>allow</code>.</p><p>It&#39;s a sliding scale between the two; it&#39;s subtler and more graduated than that.</p><hr><p>Secondly, when the action that is being compelled itself has a を-marked object</p><p>– for example, <code><em>(zeroが)</em> 犬に肉を食べさせた</code> – <code>(I) caused the dog to eat meat</code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>You can see the implied, subordinate sentence here is <code>犬が肉を食べた</code>.</p><p>The meat is the object of the dog&#39;s action,</p><p>and <strong>the dog is the thing I am causing to do that action.</strong></p><p>Now, <strong>in these kinds of sentences</strong>, Japanese does not allow us to use the を-particle twice.</p><p>Since there is an を-particle attached to the meat which is being eaten by the dog –</p><p>in other words, <strong>that&#39;s the object of the inner, subordinate sentence</strong> –</p><p><strong>we can&#39;t also use it on the dog itself who is the object or target of the causing.</strong></p><p>Why is that?</p><p>Well, really this is partly stylistic, but largely a pragmatic strategy on the part of Japanese grammar.</p><p>Not only does it sound awkward if you have two をs in the sentence, it could, in some</p><p>sentences, become ambiguous.</p><p>We might end up with some doubt as to which を marked the object associated with</p><p><code>食べる</code> (or whatever the verb is) and which を is associated with <code>せる/させる</code>, the causing of the action.</p><p>As it is, we always know that <strong>in a <code>せる/させる</code> sentence</strong>, a causative sentence,</p><p>which also has an object of the action itself, <strong>that object will always be marked by を</strong>,</p><p><strong>and the target or object of the causation</strong>, the thing be made to do something or allowed to do something or facilitated in doing something, <strong>will be marked by に.</strong></p><p>Well, that I think is the most complicated aspect of the whole thing,</p><p>and it&#39;s not really very difficult, is it?</p><p>Now, the other thing that people do find particularly difficult is the causative receptive</p><p>(what is called the <code>causative passive</code> and, when taught with the standard grammatical model,</p><p>causes people to receive a great deal of confusion)</p><h2 id="causative-receptive-causative-passive" tabindex="-1">Causative receptive / causative passive <a class="header-anchor" href="#causative-receptive-causative-passive" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Causative receptive / causative passive&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, as a matter of fact, once we have understood what the causative and the receptive really</p><p>are and really do, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything special about the causative receptive at all.</p><p>We know that helper verbs are simply verbs.</p><p>They attach to other verbs, but they are verbs in their own right.</p><p>If we don&#39;t understand this, everything becomes very difficult.</p><p>Now also, the main structural helper verbs, like the causative, the potential and the</p><p>receptive, are ichidan verbs.</p><p>So if we need to attach anything else to them, we simply do what we do with every other ichidan</p><p>verb – we take off the -る and attach whatever it is we&#39;re going to attach.</p><p>So <strong>if we want to attach the receptive to the causative, we simply take the -る off the</strong></p><p><strong>causative, <code>せる</code> or <code>させる</code>, and attach <code>られる</code></strong>, which is the ichidan helper form</p><p>of the receptive.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And it&#39;s as simple as that.</p><p>Nothing complicated about it at all.</p><p>But somebody&#39;s going to say, quite rightly,</p><p><code>But don&#39;t we have three verbs in the sentence now?</code> and that&#39;s exactly right.</p><p><strong>We have three verbs in a causative receptive sentence.</strong></p><p>For example, <code>私はブロコリを<strong>食べさせられた</strong></code> – <code>I <strong>got made to eat</strong> broccoli</code>.</p><p>So we have three verbs: <code>食べる</code> – <code>eat</code>;</p><p><code>させる</code> – <code>compel</code> (in this case it will be <code>compel</code>);</p><p><code>られる</code> – <code>receive</code>: <code>I received being compelled to eat broccoli</code>.</p><p>So, if we have three verbs, do we have three subjects?</p><p>No, <strong>we have two subjects.</strong></p><p><strong>There are always two subjects.</strong></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>In the video, the red <code>Secondary action: verb</code> has a typo <code>さらる</code>.
