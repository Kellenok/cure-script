vague,</strong></p><p><strong>make it clear that we&#39;re not talking about an exact amount or an exact degree.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And the only thing to bear in mind here is that sometimes</strong></p><p><strong>Japanese people will use this when in fact the thing in question is exact.</strong></p><p>So, for example, we might say, <code>どの<strong>くらい</strong>掛かりますか?</code> (<strong>about</strong> how much will it cost?)</p><p><strong>And we may be asking for an estimate, if it&#39;s the sort of thing where you ask for an estimate,</strong></p><p><strong>but we may also

time of arrival or... anything.</strong></p><p><strong>And this is partly because Japanese people are on the whole very precise,</strong></p><p><strong>so if they think there might be any chance of
