What schools never teach. The core Japanese sentence -organic Japanese</strong></a></p><p>The most basic thing about Japanese is the Japanese core sentence. Every Japanese sentence fundamentally has the same core. What does it look like? It looks like this.</p><p>We&#39;re going to picture it as a train. Every Japanese sentence has these two elements: <strong>the main carriage, A</strong> and <strong>the engine, B</strong>. <strong>The engine is what makes the sentence move, what makes it work.</strong> <strong>The carriage has to be there because without the carriage there&#39;s nothing for the engine to move</strong>. Those two things are the core of every Japanese sentence.</p><p>We can say more about A; we can say more about B; we can combine logical sentences together to make complex sentences. <strong>But every Japanese sentence conforms to this basic type.</strong></p><p>So, what are A and B? Let&#39;s begin by reminding ourselves that in any language there are only two kinds of sentences: <code>A is B</code> sentences and <code>A does B</code> sentences. An example of an <code>A does B</code> sentence is <code>Sakura walks</code>. An example of an <code>A is B</code> sentence is <code>Sakura is Japanese</code>.</p><p>And we can put these into the past tense; we can put them in the negative; we can turn them into questions; we can say more about A; we can say more about B. But, <strong>ultimately, every sentence boils down to one of these: an <code>A is B</code> or an <code>A does B</code> sentence.</strong></p><p>So let&#39;s look at how we do this in Japanese.</p><h2 id="verb-sentences" tabindex="-1">Verb sentences <a class="header-anchor" href="#verb-sentences" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Verb sentences&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In Japanese, if we want to say <code>Sakura walks</code> (A does B: Sakura walks), then A is Sakura, the main carriage, and B is walks, the thing she does, the engine of the sentence.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Walk in Japanese is <code>あるく</code>. We need one more thing to make the core Japanese sentence, and <strong>that is the linchpin of every sentence, が</strong> (ga).</p><p><strong>が is the center of Japanese grammar. Every Japanese sentence revolves around が. In some sentences we&#39;re not going to be able to see the が, but it&#39;s always there, and it&#39;s always doing the same job. It links together A and B and turns them into a sentence.</strong> So, our core <code>A does B</code> sentence is <code><strong>さくらが</strong>あるく</code> = <code><strong>Sakura</strong> walks</code>.</p><h2 id="copula-sentences" tabindex="-1">Copula sentences <a class="header-anchor" href="#copula-sentences" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Copula sentences&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now let&#39;s take an A is B sentence: <code>Sakura is Japanese</code>, or, as we say, <code>Sakura is a Japanese person</code>. So, A again is Sakura, B is にほんじん/日本人, which means Japanese person, and <strong>once again we need が to link them together. So we&#39;re going to picture the A car, the main carriage, with a が on it, because the main carriage, the subject of the sentence, always carries a が, to link it to the engine.</strong></p><p>So, さくらが日本人 – and we need one more thing. There&#39;s one other thing that I want you to make friends with, and that&#39;s だ (da). <code>さくらが日本人だ</code> = <code>Sakura is a Japanese person</code>.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, you may have met this だ in its fancy form, です, but there are very good reasons for learning the plain, simple form first. So we&#39;re going to learn だ. Now if you look at だ, it&#39;s like an equals sign boxed off to the left. And this is a perfect mnemonic for what it does, because <strong>だ tells us that A is B.</strong></p><p>Why is it boxed off to the left? Because it only works one way. Think about this logically: さくらが日本人だ means <code>Sakura = Japanese person.</code> But it doesn&#39;t work the other way: Japanese people are Sakura – they&#39;re not all Sakura. Sakura is a Japanese person, but a Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura.</p><h2 id="adjective-sentences" tabindex="-1">Adjective sentences <a class="header-anchor" href="#adjective-sentences" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Adjective sentences&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So now we have an <code>A is B</code> sentence and an <code>A does B</code> sentence. There is one more form of the Japanese core sentence, for it has three forms. The third form is when we have a describing word, an adjective.</p><p><strong>In Japanese, describing words end with い</strong> (i), just as they often do in English: happy, sunny, cloudy, silly. In Japanese it&#39;s just the same: happy – うれしい/嬉しい; sad – かなしい/悲しい; blue – あおい/青い.</p><p>Now, we don&#39;t have to learn all these, but we do need to know about Japanese adjectives ending in い because they make the third kind of sentence. So let&#39;s take an easy one: ペン (that&#39;s a nice easy word because it means pen) – <code>ペンが赤い/あかい</code> = <code>pen is red</code>.</p><p>Now, you notice that we don&#39;t have a だ on this sentence. Why is that? <strong>Because the い-adjective あかい/赤い (red) – it doesn&#39;t mean red, it means is-red. The だ function, the equals function, is built into those い-adjectives.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So those are the three forms of Japanese sentence. <strong>They all start with the subject of the sentence, they&#39;re all connected with が</strong>, and they can end in three ways: with a verb, which will end in う, with the copula だ, or with an い because the last word is an adjective. And now you know the basics of Japanese.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>',27),d=[h];function p(l,g,u,m,w,y){return a(),t("div",null,d)}const k=e(c,[["render",p]]);export{b as __pageData,k as default};
