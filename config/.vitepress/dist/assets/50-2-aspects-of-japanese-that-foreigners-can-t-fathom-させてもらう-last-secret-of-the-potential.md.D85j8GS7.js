Now, I&#39;ve done a whole lesson on this <em>(Lesson 19)</em></p><p>and we&#39;ve talked about most of the aspects of it which cause trouble to foreigners.</p><p>However, there&#39;s one part that I didn&#39;t go into because it wasn&#39;t really relevant at that time,</p><p>so we&#39;re going to look at that now.</p><p>As I said at the time, the causative helper verb is, for a change, very well named in</p><p>English-language Japanese grammar because that&#39;s exactly what it is -- it&#39;s the causative form.</p><p>So when we attach it to another verb what we&#39;re saying is <code>cause someone to do that verb</code>.</p><p>Now, one thing that confuses English speakers is that it can mean</p><p>either <code>allow someone to do it</code> or <code>make or compel someone to do it</code>,</p><p>and the causative verb in itself doesn&#39;t draw the distinction between those two.</p><p>That confuses English speakers because English does draw the distinction.</p><p>We say <code>make someone do something</code> or <code>let someone do something</code>;</p><p>we don&#39;t say <code>cause someone to do something</code>.</p><p>The thing we now have to understand is that the Japanese causative can mean <code>make</code>,</p><p>it can mean <code>allow</code>, but it doesn&#39;t have to mean either.</p><p>It means exactly what it says on the packet.</p><p>It means <code><em>cause -- by any means</em></code>, doesn&#39;t specify what means we&#39;re using to cause someone to do something.</p><p>And this confuses English speakers because they don&#39;t have a way of saying this.</p><p>You can&#39;t really say <code>cause someone to do something</code>, at least not in modern English.</p><p>And actually English sometimes feels the loss of this and has to make up for it by cheating with what it has.</p><p>So, an example of that is when we say <code>Would you let me know tomorrow?</code> or <code>I&#39;ll let you know tomorrow</code>.</p><p>We don&#39;t actually mean <code>let you know</code> or <code>let me know</code>.</p><p>We mean <code>cause me to know</code>.</p><p>We don&#39;t mean <code>allow me to know</code>; we don&#39;t mean <code>force me to know</code>.</p><p>We mean <code>cause me to know</code>.</p><p>But because we don&#39;t have this <code>cause someone to do something</code> expression in modern English, we actually have to cheat and say <code>let me know</code>, which isn&#39;t what we really mean.</p><p>In Japanese, of course, we use the causative for this.</p><p>So, <code>知る</code> is <code>know</code> and <code>知らせる</code> is <code>cause someone to know</code>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So this is essentially doing what English <code>let me know</code> is doing,</p><p>without having to bend the grammar to do it the way English does.</p><p>And this causative can be used in many other ways that don&#39;t mean either <code>make</code> or <code>allow</code>.</p><p>So <code>聞く</code>, for example, is <code>hear</code>; so <code>聞かせる</code> means <code>cause to hear</code>.</p><p>And we might say <code>後で聞かせよう</code>, which means &quot;I&#39;ll tell you tomorrow <em>(later on)</em> /</p><p>tomorrow I&#39;ll cause you to hear / tomorrow I&#39;ll give you all the information&quot;.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And we can lego this together with other words, so we can have something like <code>読み聞かせる</code>,</p><p>which means <code>read and cause to hear</code>/<em>read-cause-to-hear</em>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And this is what we say if we&#39;re reading someone a story, reading a letter to someone,</p><p>or something like that: <code>読み聞かせる</code></p><p>And once we understand this way in which the causative helper works,</p><p>we can see how it gets て-formed to have <code>もらう</code> attached to it.</p><p>For example, we might say <code>聞かせてもらえますか</code>, which means <code>Can you tell me?</code></p><p><code>聞かせて</code> -- <code>cause me to hear</code>; <code>もらえる</code>, which is the potential form of <code>もらう</code>, in other words <code>possible to receive</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>Is it possible to receive you causing me to hear?</code> which in English, we&#39;d probably say <code>Can you tell me?</code></p><p>So, this <code>聞かせてもらえますか</code> might seem very confusing to a foreign speaker because it isn&#39;t</p><p>how we put it in English, but, as you can see, structurally it&#39;s very straightforward.</p><p>It&#39;s built out of elements that we already know and understand and it makes perfect sense.</p><p>We could take the sentence <code>学生でも下宿させてもらえませんか</code>.</p><p>And this would tend to get translated as meaning <code>Do you take in students?</code></p><p>But literally what it&#39;s saying is <code>Even if one is a student ...</code> -- <code>学生でも</code> --</p><p><code>...is it not possible to receive being caused to lodge here?</code></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That&#39;s the structure of this, so when you see this <code>学生でも下宿させてもらえませんか</code></p><p>and you get told that it means <code>Do you take in students?</code>, you can look at it backwards,</p><p>forwards and upside down and wonder how those words come to mean that.</p><p>And of course they don&#39;t really come to mean that at all. That&#39;s just what we would say in English. In Japanese we&#39;re saying <code>Even if one is a student, is it not possible to receive being caused to lodge here?</code></p><p>And it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be oneself that&#39;s being caused to do something in these sentences.</p><p>For example, if we say <code><em>(zeroが)</em> メガネを合わせてもらった</code>,<br> this gets translated as <code>I was fitted for glasses</code>,</p><p>but what it literally means is <code>to receive the glasses being caused to fit</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So it&#39;s the glasses that are being caused.</p><p>They&#39;re the ones that are being <code>させる</code>-ed, but I am the one receiving their being caused to fit.</p><p>So it doesn&#39;t have to be me personally receiving being caused.</p><p>I could be receiving something else being caused as well.</p><p>So, we have to look at the sentence and see what it means and, of course,</p><p>apply the rules we talked about in the lesson about busting ambiguity <strong>(Lesson 48)</strong> --</p><p>we look at what&#39;s most probable, knowing that if something improbable is being said</p><p>the speaker will have to make that clear, just as they do in English.</p><p>Now, sometimes of course it can actually mean <code>allow</code>, so for example if we say<br><code>帰らせてもらいます</code>,</p><p>what we&#39;re really literally saying is <code>I will receive your allowing me to go home</code>.</p><p>That&#39;s the literal meaning.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s rather like saying in English <code>With your permission, I&#39;ll leave now</code>, which could very well mean <code>I&#39;ll leave now, with or without your permission</code>, but it puts a veneer of politeness over the matter.</p><p>And whether it&#39;s genuinely polite or whether it&#39;s just informing someone that you&#39;re going with a thin veneer of politeness, this is something you&#39;ll obviously grasp from context and tone of voice etc., just as you would in English.</p><p>There&#39;s a considerable difference between saying &quot;With your permission I&#39;ll go home now**** [softly]</p><p>and saying &quot;With your permission I&#39;ll go home now**** [harshly] --</p><p>and that&#39;s just the same in Japanese as in English.</p><p>So, as you see, there are many ways in which these elements can be combined,</p><p>but if we understand each of them and we understand how they fit together,</p><p>we have the tools necessary to assimilate from immersion how these things are used.</p><p>Remember, <em>structure doesn&#39;t teach us how to understand Japanese.</em></p><p><strong>It gives us the basic tools we need in order to pick it up from the only place you can</strong></p><p><strong>really learn how a language works</strong> -- and that is <strong>direct immersion</strong>.</p><hr><p>And I&#39;ll just add before we go... I&#39;m not teaching 敬語/けいご at this point.</p><p>敬語 is hyper-polite Japanese, which is almost a little sub-language of its own.</p><p>It&#39;s not that difficult, but it will take a few lessons to go into it.</p><p>But I want to mention here that there is a 敬語 word for <code>もらう</code>. And that is <code>頂く/いただく</code>.</p><p>Because it&#39;s hyper-polite, it&#39;s usually used in ます-form, so it&#39;s usually <code>いただきます</code>.</p><p>And undoubtedly you&#39;ll be familiar with that as being the thing people say before they eat:<br><code>いただきます!</code></p><p>But what it literally means is something like <code>I humbly receive</code>.</p><p>It obviously means <code>I receive</code>, because <code>いただく</code> means <code>もらう</code>,</p><p>but it is a form of 敬語 called <code>謙譲語/けんじょうご</code>or <code>humble language</code>, so you&#39;re saying<br><code>I humbly receive</code>.</p><p>And I&#39;m mentioning this at this point because you will probably see</p><p>some of these <code>させてもらう</code>-type forms used with <code>いただく</code>: <code>させていただきます</code> etc.</p><p>And this piece of 敬語 can get used a little more often than regular 敬語</p><p>because it adds politeness to the concept of <code>もらう</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So sometimes if there seems to be a danger of being a bit demanding or grabby by saying what you&#39;re going to receive or what you want to receive,</p><p>you might use <code>いただく</code> to take the edge off that and show that you&#39;re actually being humble and polite.</p><p>So if you see <code>いただく / いただきます</code> used in any of these places,</p><p>it means exactly the same thing as <code>もらう</code>. It&#39;s just putting a more polite edge on it.</p><p>So you needn&#39;t be confused by that when you see it.</p>',115),u=[m];function g(w,f,y,b,v,_){return t(),o("div",null,u)}const A=e(l,[["render",g]]);export{I as __pageData,A as default};
