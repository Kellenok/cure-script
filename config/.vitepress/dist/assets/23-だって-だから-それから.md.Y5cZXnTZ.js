23: だって Datte: what it REALLY means (hint: it&#39;s not a word) + dakara, sore kara</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about <code>だって</code></p><p>and some of the issues that raises about the use of <code>だ</code> and <code>です</code>.</p><p>One of my commenters spoke about being confused by the <code>word</code> <code>だって</code> and I&#39;m not surprised, because if you look at the Japanese-English dictionaries they tell you that</p><p><code>だって</code> means <code>because</code> and <code>but</code> and <code>even</code> and also <code>somebody said</code>, which is quite a confusing pile of meanings for one so-called word.</p><p><strong>And I say <code>so-called</code> word because <code>だって</code> isn&#39;t really even a word.</strong></p><p>And the thing that never seems to get explained in dictionaries or anywhere else is what it</p><p>really is, what it actually means, and therefore why it carries the range of meanings that it does.</p><p>So, let&#39;s start off with the most basic meaning, which is the last one on the list,</p><p><code>somebody said</code>.</p><h2 id="だって-as-somebody-said" tabindex="-1">だって as <code>somebody said</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#だって-as-somebody-said" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;だって as &lt;code&gt;somebody said&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong><code>だって</code> is actually simply made up of the copula <code>だ</code> plus って,</strong></p><p><strong>which is not the て-form of anything, it&#39;s the って which is a contraction</strong>,</p><p>as we&#39;ve talked about before <em>(Lesson 18)</em>, <strong>of the quotation particle -と plus <code>いう</code>.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>So って means <code>-という</code>, in other words, <code>says</code> a particular thing.</strong></p><p>The <strong>-と bundles up something into a quotation and the <code>いう</code> says that somebody says it.</strong></p><p>So it&#39;s really as simple as that.</p><p><code><em>(zeroが)</em> 明日は晴れ<strong>だって</strong></code> is simply <code><em>(zeroが)</em> 明日が晴れ**...**</code></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>晴れ</code> means <code>sunny</code> or <code>clear skies</code> – and as with most words where there&#39;s some doubt</p><p>of what kind of word they are, they usually turn out to be nouns, <strong><code>晴れ</code> is a noun.</strong></p><p>So, <code>明日は晴れだ</code> simply means <code>Tomorrow will be sunny</code>.</p><p>And when we add って, we&#39;re saying, <code><strong>It&#39;s said that</strong> tomorrow will be fine</code>.</p><p><strong>We might be saying that someone in particular says it or<br> we may just be saying <code>it&#39;s said</code> in general</strong> –</p><p><code>I hear tomorrow will be fine</code>, we might say in English.</p><p><code>They say tomorrow will be fine.</code></p><p>So that&#39;s very simple, and <strong>that&#39;s what <code>だって</code> is:</strong></p><p><strong>it&#39;s <code>だ</code> plus って, the <code>-という</code> contraction.</strong></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And that&#39;s what it is in all the other cases too, so let&#39;s see how it works.</p><p>How does it come to mean <code>but</code>?</p><h2 id="だって-as-but" tabindex="-1">だって as <code>but</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#だって-as-but" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;だって as &lt;code&gt;but&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Well, to begin with let&#39;s understand that <strong>when it&#39;s used on its own</strong> –</p><p>and <strong>it means <code>but</code> when it&#39;s used on its own, not as the ending of a sentence</strong></p><p>as in the example we just looked at –</p><p><strong>it has a slightly childish and usually somewhat negative or argumentative feeling.</strong></p><p>So if somebody says, <code>さくらがきれいだね</code> – <code>Sakura&#39;s pretty, isn&#39;t it?</code></p><p>And you say <code><strong>だって</strong>頭が弱い</code>.</p><p>Now <code>頭が弱い</code> means literally <code>head is weak</code> – <code>She is not very smart</code>.</p><p>So it would be like saying, <code><strong>But</strong> she&#39;s not very smart</code>.</p><p><strong>But what you&#39;re actually doing here is taking the statement that the last person said and</strong></p><p><strong>adding the copula <code>だ</code> to it.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And in order to understand that let&#39;s look for a moment at something else.</p><h3 id="ですね" tabindex="-1">ですね <a class="header-anchor" href="#ですね" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ですね&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Very often, when we&#39;re agreeing with something someone says, we might say <code>ですね</code>.</p><p>And literally that just means <code>is, isn&#39;t it?</code></p><p>And how can it mean that, because really <code>だ</code> or <code>です</code> <strong>on its own doesn&#39;t mean anything.</strong></p><p>It has to join two other things together, and neither of them are stated here.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>But what <code>です</code> is by implication attached to is the thing the person just said.</strong></p><p>And <strong>what it&#39;s joining it to is</strong>, by implication, <strong>something like <code>本当</code> or <code>そう</code></strong> – <code><strong>そう</strong>ですね</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we&#39;re actually saying</p><p><code><strong>That&#39;s true</strong>, isn&#39;t it?</code> or <code><strong>That&#39;s the case</strong>, isn&#39;t it?</code> or <code><strong>That&#39;s how it is</strong>, isn&#39;t it?</code></p><h2 id="それから-だから-ですから" tabindex="-1">それから &amp; だから / ですから <a class="header-anchor" href="#それから-だから-ですから" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;それから &amp; だから / ですから&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We also do this when we say <code><strong>だから</strong></code> or <code><strong>ですから</strong></code>, which really means <code><strong>because</strong></code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, we know that <code>から</code> means <code>because</code>;</p><p>it means literally <code>from</code> and therefore also means <code>because</code>.</p><p><strong>From A, B. From Fact A we can derive Fact B. From Fact A, Fact B emerges.</strong></p><p><strong>So, <code>から</code> – <code>because</code>.</strong></p><p>We may be tempted sometimes to say <code>それから</code>,</p><p>which is a literal translation of the English <code>because of that</code>.</p><p><strong>But in fact <code>それから</code> doesn&#39;t get used to mean <code>because of that</code>.</strong></p><p><code>それ</code> means <code>that</code> and <code>から</code> can mean &#39;because&quot;,</p><p><strong>but <code>それから</code> usually means <code>after that</code></strong> – <code>から</code> in the more literal sense,</p><p><strong><code>から</code> meaning <code>from</code>, and in this case <code>from</code> in point of time rather than space.</strong></p><p><code>From that forward / from that forward in time / after that</code>; <code>それから</code> – <code>after that</code>.</p><hr><p>To say <code><strong>because of that</strong></code>, we say <code><strong>ですから</strong></code> or <code><strong>だから</strong></code>, and this is really short for</p><p><code><strong>それはそうですから</strong></code> or <code><strong>それは本当ですから</strong></code>.👇</p><p>We&#39;re saying <code><strong>because that is the case</strong></code>, and if you think of it,</p><p>this is more logical than what we say in English. We&#39;re saying <code>because that is the case</code>.</p><p><code>Because of that</code> really means literally in English <code>because that is the case</code></p><p>but we just cut it down to <code>because of that</code>, 👇</p><p>and <strong>in Japanese we just cut it down to <code>ですから</code>.</strong></p><h2 id="back-to-だって-as-but" tabindex="-1">Back to だって as <code>but</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#back-to-だって-as-but" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Back to だって as &lt;code&gt;but&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, when we understand this, we can understand <code>だって</code> in the sense of meaning <code>but</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><code>だ</code> refers back to whatever it was the last person said,<br> and って simply states that they said it.</strong></p><p>So, if someone says, <code>さくらがきれいだね</code> – Sakura&#39;s pretty, isn&#39;t it, isn&#39;t she?&quot;</p><p>And you reply, <code><strong>だって</strong>頭が弱い</code>.</p><p>Now, <strong>the <code>but</code> here is you saying <code>You said that...</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>And <code>だって</code> is a rather childish and argumentative-sounding way of saying it, so the implication is that what comes next is going to be negating what was said.</strong></p><hr><p>And this works in just the same way as English <code>but</code>.</p><p>If you think about it, <strong><code>but</code> is not saying that what came before it is untrue.</strong></p><p><strong>In fact it is accepting that what came before it is true, but it&#39;s then adding some information that is contrary to the impression given by that statement.</strong></p><hr><p>So <code>さくらがきれいだね</code> – <code>Sakura is pretty</code> –</p><p><code><strong>だって</strong>...</code>– <code><strong>You said that and I&#39;m not disputing that that is the case, BUT</strong> – she&#39;s not very smart</code>.</p><h2 id="だって-as-because" tabindex="-1">だって as <code>because</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#だって-as-because" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;だって as &lt;code&gt;because&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, how does it come to mean <code>because</code>, which in some ways seems almost opposed to <code>but</code>,</p><p>almost an opposite kind of meaning?</p><p>Well, let&#39;s notice that <strong>one thing that <code>but</code> and <code>because</code> have in common is that they accept the first statement.</strong></p><p><code>But</code> goes on to say something which contrasts with that statement,</p><p>while still accepting it.</p><p><strong><code>Because</code> says something that goes on to explain that statement.</strong></p><p>And <strong>this can be a harmonious explanation which simply gives us more information about it, but it can also be a contradictory explanation.</strong></p><p>So, for example, if someone says, <code>You haven&#39;t done much of your homework</code></p><p>and you reply, <code>Because you keep talking to me!</code></p><p><strong>This could be expressed by <code>だって</code> in Japanese.</strong></p><p>Again, what it&#39;s really saying is &quot;You say that and I don&#39;t dispute it, <strong>but here&#39;s something</strong></p><p><strong>we can add to it which undermines the narrative that you are trying to put forward.&quot;</strong></p><hr><p>So you see, it doesn&#39;t literally mean either <code>but</code> or <code>because</code>.</p><p><strong>What it means is,</strong></p><p><strong><code>I accept your statement and now I&#39;m going to add something a bit argumentative</code>.</strong></p><p>In English it could be translated as either <code>but</code> or <code>because</code></p><p>depending on the circumstances.</p><h2 id="だって-as-even" tabindex="-1">だって as <code>even</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#だって-as-even" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;だって as &lt;code&gt;even&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, how can it come to have the meaning of <code>even</code>?</p><p>Well, let&#39;s understand that this is a slightly different use.</p><p><strong>When we use it to mean <code>even</code>, we&#39;re not using the <code>だ</code> in the way we&#39;re using it when we say <code>だから</code> or <code>だって</code> in the senses we&#39;ve just talked about.</strong></p><p>In other words, <strong>we are not simply using it to refer back to the last statement.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>We&#39;re usually attaching it to something in particular within the statement we&#39;re making.</strong></p><p>So, if you say, <code>さくらはできる</code> – <code>Sakura can do that</code> and I say <code><strong>私だって</strong>できる</code>,</p><p>which is generally translated as <code><strong>Even I</strong> can do that</code>,</p><p>what we&#39;re actually saying is <code><strong>Say it&#39;s me</strong></code>,</p><p>which means in both Japanese and English <code><strong>Take the hypothesis that it&#39;s me</strong></code></p><p>or <code><strong>Take the case of me in this circumstance</strong></code> and we&#39;re saying</p><p><code>私だってできる</code></p><p><code>Say it&#39;s me, I can do that</code>.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, this has a different implication from <code>私<strong>も</strong>できる</code>, <strong>which just means neutrally</strong></p><p><code>I can do that <strong>too</strong></code>.</p><p><code>私<strong>だって</strong></code>, <strong>because it&#39;s very colloquial and because it&#39;s associated with this slightly</strong></p><p><strong>negative or contradictory implication</strong>, it means <code><strong>Even</strong> I can do that</code>.</p><hr><p><strong>And it doesn&#39;t have to be negative in the sense of contradicting anything.</strong></p><p>Outside the context of Sakura, we might just say, <code>私だってホットケーキが<strong>作れる</strong></code></p><p>– <code>Even I can make hotcakes</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Dolly-先生 misspeaks by saying 作られる, but as a Godan potential, it should be 作れる.<br> 作られる is the receptive form of 作る - we take う off, add あ stem + れる. Potential is え + る.</p></div><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And in this case, <strong>we&#39;re not saying it negatively,</strong></p><p><strong>but that <code>私だって</code> still has the implication of <code>even me</code>.</strong></p><p>It still has its slightly disparaging or negative ring, because what you&#39;re saying is here</p><p><code><strong>Even someone like me, even me, who can&#39;t usually make very much</strong>, can make hotcakes</code>.</p><p>So I hope this makes <code>だって</code> clearer and also the ways in which</p><p><code>だ/です</code> can be used to accept and affirm previous statements made by oneself or by someone else and add something to it.</p>',145)]))}const S=o(m,[["render",u]]);export{_ as __pageData,S as default};
