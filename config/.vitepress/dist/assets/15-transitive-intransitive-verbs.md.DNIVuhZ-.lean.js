Transitive/intransitive verbs unlocked</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to look at self-move and other-move words.</p><p>If you look in a standard Japanese textbook or dictionary,</p><p>you usually see these defined as <code>transitive</code> and <code>intransitive</code> verbs.</p><p>Now, this isn&#39;t as far off as some of the things you find in these books, such as conjugation, which doesn&#39;t exist in Japanese; passive (there is no passive in Japanese).</p><p><strong>Transitivity and intransitivity does exist in Japanese and most of the time there is a big overlap between that and self-move and other-move verbs.</strong></p><p>However, it doesn&#39;t work all the time and it isn&#39;t exactly what is meant by self-move and other-move in Japanese.</p><p>So, if you&#39;re familiar and comfortable with the Western terms <code>transitive</code> and <code>intransitive</code>, it doesn&#39;t hurt a lot if you use them, at least not most of the time.</p><p>But if you&#39;re not familiar with them, don&#39;t try to learn them just for the sake of Japanese, because they&#39;re not really accurate.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>My guess is in regards to English, since a lot of verbs that are transitive in English are not in Japanese etc., basically it is better to regard the two as their own entities to avoid confusion.</p></div><hr><p>So what are self-move and other-move words?</p><p><strong>In Japanese, a move-word, <code> 動詞 (doushi)</code>, is a verb,</strong></p><p><strong>a word that denotes an action or a movement.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>So a self-move word is any verb that moves itself. So if I stand up, that&#39;s a self-move action. I&#39;m not moving something else, I&#39;m moving myself.</strong></p><p><strong>If I throw a ball, that&#39;s an other-move action. I&#39;m not throwing myself, I&#39;m throwing the ball.</strong> And really it&#39;s as simple as that.</p><hr><p><strong>Now, Japanese has a lot of pairs of words – so we could say they&#39;re either two forms of the same word or two very closely related words – where we have a self-move and an other-move version.</strong></p><p>So, one very good example is <code>出る(でる)</code> and <code>出す(だす)</code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>They both use the same kanji which means <code>come out</code>.</p><p><strong>The base form is <code>出る(でる)</code> and that means simply <code>come out</code> or <code>emerge</code>, and that&#39;s the self-move version.</strong></p><p><strong>The other-move version is <code>出す(だす)</code> and that means <code>take out</code> or <code>bring out</code>: cause something to come out. <em>/ Take something out etc…</em></strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Not to confuse the translation <code>cause something to</code> as denoting causative (Lesson 19),<br> 出す has its own <code>causative</code> form - 出させる(ださせる) that denotes **<a href="https://www.weblio.jp/content/%E5%87%BA%E3%81%95%E3%81%9B%E3%82%8B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">its causative form</a>.<br><em>Here, you are doing the action of moving something. You are not making someone else do it.</em></p></div><p>So in the first case whatever it is is moving itself; it&#39;s coming out; it&#39;s emerging.</p><p><strong>In the second case, the actor of the sentence, the actor of the verb, is bringing something else out or taking something else out.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>so, just like transitive, other-move SEEMS to imply something to the grammar object, whereas intransitive/self-move verb has no direct object, since it describes/<code>moves</code> just itself.</p></div><p>Now, this is often very useful, because in many cases it gives us two distinct words that are easy to understand because they&#39;re closely related.</p><hr><p>For example, <code>負ける (まける)</code> means <code>lose</code> – it doesn&#39;t mean lose an object or lose money, but lose a contest, lose a war, lose a battle, lose a game – be defeated, in other words.</p><p>Now, <code><strong>負かす(まかす)</strong></code>, which is the other-move version of <code><strong>負ける (まける)</strong></code>, means <code>defeat</code> – in other words, cause someone else to lose / <em>defeat someone</em>.</p><p>So where we have two words in English, <code>lose</code> and <code>defeat</code>, in Japanese we have fundamentally the same word in its self-move and its other-move versions.</p><hr><p>So that&#39;s very useful – but not so useful if you don&#39;t understand how to form self-move</p><p>and other-move versions of a word. If you look in the standard textbooks, most of the time they&#39;re going to tell you that you just have to learn all the self-move and all the other-move words separately. Sometimes they give you lists of self-move and other-move pairs – transitivity pairs, as they call them. But this isn&#39;t true and it isn&#39;t necessary.</p><p>Most of the time we can tell which is a self-move word and which is an other-move word.</p><p>There are a few very simple rules that cover most of the move-word pairs.</p><p>And those rules are even easier if you understand the logic that underlies them.</p><p>And that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to learn right now.</p><h2 id="ある-する" tabindex="-1">ある ＆ する <a class="header-anchor" href="#ある-する" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ある ＆ する&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The first thing to know is that there is, as it were, an Adam and Eve of self-move and</p><p>other-move words, the mother and father of them all. And these are <code>ある</code> and <code>する</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><code>ある</code> is the mother of all self-move words. It simply means <code>be</code>. So it&#39;s a completely inward-directed verb. You can&#39;t be or exist something else; you can only be and exist in yourself. It&#39;s fundamentally and absolutely inward-directed, self-directed.</strong></p><hr><p><strong><code>する</code>, on the other hand, means <code>do</code>. So they mean <code>be</code> and <code>do</code>. And <code>する</code> in itself, just doing, can never exist on its own, you have to be doing something. So this is the father of all other-move verbs.</strong></p><h2 id="する-family-rule" tabindex="-1">する Family Rule <a class="header-anchor" href="#する-family-rule" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;する Family Rule&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now why do we need to know that, why is it important to know that? Because when we know that, it unlocks most of the move-word pairs that we&#39;re going to encounter.How does it do that?</p><p>Well, there are what I call 3 laws of move-word pairs.</p><p><strong>And the first of those laws is that if one of a pair ends in -す, that is going to be the other-move word, always. Why? Because that -す is related to <code>する</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, in the example we gave before, <code>出る (でる) / 出す (だす)</code>,</p><p><code>出る(でる)</code> means <code>come out</code> and <code>出す（だす)</code>, <strong>which ends in -す, is the other-move verb</strong> – that&#39;s the one that means <code>take <strong>(something else)</strong> out</code>. <em>- it requires a grammatical Object.</em></p><p>In <code>負ける(まける) / 負かす(まかす)</code>, <strong>we know that the other-move verb</strong>, the verb that means <code>make (someone else) lose</code> is <code>負か<strong>す</strong>(まかす)</code> <strong>because it ends in -す.</strong></p><p>And an awful lot of those -す pairs actually make that particular transformation, -える to</p><p>-す. <strong>But not always.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In some cases... we have, for example, <code> 落ちる (おちる)</code>, which means <code>fall</code>, and <code>落とす (おとす)</code>, which means <code>drop</code>. They have the same kanji; they are a pair, they don&#39;t have that regular -える to -す ending, but <code>落とす (おとす)</code> still has -す on the end,</p><p>so we still know that that is the other-move partner of the pair.</p><h2 id="ある-family-rule" tabindex="-1">ある Family Rule <a class="header-anchor" href="#ある-family-rule" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ある Family Rule&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <strong>the second rule is that where one of a pair ends in any of the あ-stem + -る</strong>, so</p><p>it ends in the sound -ある, <strong>that is going to be the self-move partner of the pair</strong>. Why?</p><p>Because that -ある is related to <code>ある</code>, the mother of all self-move verbs.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The usual pattern here is -える to -ある.</p><p>We already looked at that in the last lesson, where we have <code>上がる (あがる)</code>, which means <code>rise up/get up</code>, and <code>上げる (あげる)</code>, which means <code>raise (something) up</code>.</p><p>It is very often used to mean to <code>give (something) upward (to another person)</code>.</p><p>So we have <code>上がる (あがる)</code> and<code>上げる(あげる)</code>, and we know that the self-move partner of the pair is <code>上がる (あがる)</code> because it ends in -ある.</p><p>The usual form here is -える to -ある, <strong>but again it doesn&#39;t have to be.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>There are other cases, such as <code>包む(くるむ)</code>, which means <code>wrap</code>, and <code>包まる(くるまる)</code>, which means <code>be wrapped</code>, but again it doesn&#39;t matter because we know that</p><p><strong>the one ending in -ある is always going to be the self-move partner of the pair.</strong></p><h2 id="switch-rule" tabindex="-1">Switch Rule <a class="header-anchor" href="#switch-rule" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Switch Rule&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <strong>the third law is that if we take any regular verb ending in -う sound</strong> (as they all</p><p>do) <strong>and change it to the え-row and add -る, which means that it ends in -える, that flips</strong></p><p><strong>a self-move word to an other-move word or an other-move word to a self-move word.</strong></p><p><strong>The problem is that we don&#39;t in every case know from the structure which way the</strong></p><p><strong>word will be flipped.</strong></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>However, this is not as difficult as it seems, because first of all this is not a large number</p><p>of verbs – the majority are covered by the first two rules – <strong>and of this group of -う</strong></p><p><strong>to -える flips, the majority is -む to -める</strong>.</p><p>And <strong>-める is – I would call this an honorary member of the す family.</strong></p><p><strong>Or you could say that -む to -める is the honorary fourth law.</strong></p><p>Whichever way you put it, <strong>in -む to -める, -める is always the other-move partner of the pair.</strong></p><p>And indeed as you get more experienced in Japanese, you will get to feel that</p><p><strong>める-ending verbs have a する-like other-move feeling to them.</strong></p><hr><p>And this really is all you need to know if you&#39;re beginning with self-move/other-move</p><p>verbs, because this covers really the vast majority of all the pairs you&#39;re going to encounter.</p><p>So don&#39;t feel that you have to learn the rest of this lesson. You can come back to it later whenever you want to.</p><p>But I&#39;m going to just complete it, partly so that you have all the information you might need for the future and partly because it&#39;s going to give us more insight into how self-move and other-move really works.</p><h2 id="honorary-rules" tabindex="-1">Honorary Rules <a class="header-anchor" href="#honorary-rules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Honorary Rules&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So the next thing to know is that as well as -む/-める, which is the big one, there</p><p>are also other honorary members of the す family and these are:</p><p>-ぶ to -べる – <strong>-べる is always the other-move version</strong> (and -ぶ and -む are very close in Japanese;</p><p>you may know <code>さびしい/さみしい</code> and other words like that, where you can just use ぶ or む in the same word, <strong>so -める and -べる naturally are both honorary members of the す family</strong>).</p><p>And also -つ/-てる – <strong>the -てる is always the other-move pair.</strong></p><p>So in the end we really have very few wild cards in this pack.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>The only ones that we really can&#39;t tell which way they are going is</strong></p><p><strong>-く and -ぐ, to -ける and -げる,</strong></p><p><strong>-う to -える, and those る-ending verbs that don&#39;t fit either of the first two laws.</strong></p><p>So these are in fact the only exceptions where you really can&#39;t tell structurally which way they are going.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So is there anything we can actually do about this last small minority of self-move/other-move flips? And the answer to that is yes.</p><p>But it&#39;s a little bit subtler and it will become easier as you become more competent in Japanese.</p><p>So you don&#39;t need to worry about this if you&#39;re at an early stage.</p><p>The rules I&#39;ve given you cover most of the cases.</p><p><strong>But when we take a verb that structurally you can&#39;t tell which way it&#39;s flipping, a lot of the time we can tell semantically</strong> – that&#39;s to say, that <strong>when I say that the え-row plus -る flips transitivity, I mean exactly that.</strong></p><p><strong>The -える version is the flipped version;</strong></p><p><strong>the -う version is the original, the one that&#39;s in the basic form of the verb.</strong></p><p>So to take an example, <code>売<strong>る</strong>(うる)</code> means <code>sell</code>; it&#39;s a very common word.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>There&#39;s a less common version of it which is <code>売<strong>れる</strong>(うれる)</code>, and <strong>that&#39;s the flipped version.</strong> Now, <code>selling</code> is obviously an other-move verb – I sell <strong>something</strong>.</p><p>You can&#39;t just sell in the abstract. I sell something-or-other and so I&#39;m moving that other thing – quite literally.</p><p>But <code>売れる(うれる)</code> means <code>sell</code> in the other sense, as in <code>that game is selling like hot cakes</code>.</p><p>So <strong>in this case, they&#39;re talking about a book selling or a game selling, so the thing that</strong></p><p><strong>is doing the selling here is also the thing that is moving, so this is a self-move version</strong>, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>So it&#39;s clear that <code>売る(うる)</code> is basically an other-move verb but when it&#39;s flipped it has</strong></p><p><strong>a self-move version.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, if we take one that goes the other way,</p><p><code>従<strong>う</strong>(したがう)</code> means <code>obey</code> or <code>follow</code>,</p><p>and it has a flipped version, <code>従<strong>える</strong>(したがえる)</code>, which means to <code>be followed by</code> or <code>be obeyed by</code>.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, it&#39;s clear here that <strong>the basic idea is obeying or following and that the extended</strong></p><p><strong>idea is being obeyed or being followed.</strong></p><p>So <strong>here it&#39;s clear that the other-move version is going to be the -える version, because that&#39;s the flipped version of the basic concept, to obey or follow.</strong></p><hr><p>And we can also note here for those of you who&#39;ve been asking yourselves,</p><p><code>Why does she say that transitive and intransitive aren&#39;t correct?</code> – this is an example.</p><p>The Japanese-English dictionaries tell us that <code>従う(したがう)</code> is the intransitive version, but if you think about it <code>従う(したがう)</code> means <code>obey</code> or <code>follow</code>. This is not an intransitive word.</p><p>You can&#39;t just obey or follow in the abstract. You obey someone or you follow someone. It&#39;s a transitive verb.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Dolly wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELk1dqaEmyk&amp;lc=UgxUPDAQZ2p43DA_Z294AaABAg.8pKE8ZA_tQh8pKQIhLE8L6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>this</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELk1dqaEmyk&amp;lc=Ugw4tQMZRgx1xrAmnOh4AaABAg.9CQONWHmDUq9CQeZrqyaG2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>this</strong></a>, there is also <a href="https://ameblo.jp/stravaganza-no2/entry-12013152846.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>this Japanese article</strong></a> about some self-move/intransitive? verbs using を, which is normally…ungrammatical?, I am not entirely confident in explaining it since my Japanese is still quite limited, so if anything you can write me,</p></div><p>I guess it would be beneficial not to view them purely in transitive = always other-move etc.<br> So I recommend you do your own research about this problem and decide how to go about it.*</p><p>So why do the dictionaries call it intransitive?</p><p><strong>Because they have made the commitment to translating self-move as intransitive, but while it&#39;s a transitive verb – you obey someone, you follow someone – it is also a self-move verb.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>In obeying someone or following someone, you are not moving that other person.</strong></p><p><strong>You are moving yourself.</strong></p><p><strong>In being obeyed or being followed, you are not moving yourself, you&#39;re moving that other person.</strong></p><p>So this is one of the cases where self-move and other-move do not correspond to transitive and intransitive.</p><hr><p><strong>There aren&#39;t too many of those cases, so it doesn&#39;t matter if you want to use transitive</strong></p><p><strong>and intransitive, just be aware that the meaning is not exactly the same in any case, and in some cases it doesn&#39;t fit at all.</strong></p><p>Now, as I say, if you just want to remember the three rules and nothing else, that is</p><p>going to break the back of self-move and other-move verbs for you.</p><p>In most cases, you can understand them with nothing but that.</p><p>So the rest of what I&#39;ve told you is very useful as you become more proficient at Japanese, but</p><p>if you just remember the concept of self-move and other-move and the three basic rules:</p><p><strong>the -ある version is always self-move,</strong></p><p><strong>the -す and -せる versions are always other-move</strong></p><p>and if you also remember that <strong>the -める version is always other-move</strong>, that&#39;s worth throwing in because that covers a lot.</p><p>And with those, you really have the problem of self-move and other-move verbs mostly under control.</p>',158)]))}const S=t(v,[["render",w]]);export{x as __pageData,S as default};
