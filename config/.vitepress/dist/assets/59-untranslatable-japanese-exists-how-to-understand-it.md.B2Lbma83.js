How to understand it | Lesson 59</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about something</p><p>that makes quite a range of Japanese sentences</p><p>difficult for English learners to understand.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And that is something that I call</p><p><code>the problem of passivity in Japanese</code>.</p><p>And I&#39;m not talking here about the so-called Japanese passive,</p><p>which is actually the receptive helper verb.</p><p>That&#39;s a problem because of the tendency to call it passive when it isn&#39;t,</p><p>but there are actually several Japanese constructions that go deeper than this</p><p>and cause problems by being regarded and translated as passive</p><p>even though they&#39;re not actually called passive.</p><p>And this matters because if we see them as being passive, then we&#39;re going to misunderstand the sentences, we&#39;re not going to understand why the logical particles are in the places that they are and, especially with more complex sentences,<br> we&#39;re just not going to be able to work out what&#39;s going on at all.</p><p>Now, as I&#39;ve said before,</p><p>there is not any actual passive voice in Japanese,</p><p>but something to consider here is that</p><p>there is something that we can call</p><p>the passive nature of Japanese as a whole.</p><p>And this has nothing to do with the grammatical</p><p>passive voice as it exists in English.</p><p>This is more of a philosophical than a grammatical passivity.</p><p>And by <code>passive</code> here I simply mean the opposite of active.</p><p>As I&#39;ve explained before, the Adam and Eve of Japanese verbs are <code>ある</code> and <code>する</code>,</p><p><code>ある</code> meaning <code>be</code> and <code>する</code> meaning <code>do</code>.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And while we call them the <code>Adam and Eve</code>,</p><p>we should really refer to them as the <code>Eve and Adam</code>,</p><p>because there is a tendency in Japanese to regard <code>being</code> as prior and primary to <code>doing</code>, whereas English tends to think of things the other way around.</p><p>It tends to be activist in nature.</p><p>And there are a whole range of Japanese verbs</p><p>which depict not actions as we understand them</p><p>but states of being which are regarded grammatically</p><p>as if they were in fact actions.</p><p>And again, understanding that this is the case is</p><p>vitally important to understanding how sentences work.</p><p>And we can start this off with something that isn&#39;t</p><p>in fact usually translated as passive but would</p><p>be a little bit better if it were translated as passive</p><p>and that is something we&#39;ve looked at already in another context,</p><p>which is that if we say <code>本が分かる</code>,</p><p>this gets translated into English as <code>I understand the book</code></p><p>and it doesn&#39;t mean that at all, because as we can see</p><p>the book is the が-marked subject of the sentence.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So it&#39;s the book that&#39;s doing something, not me. I&#39;m not doing anything.</p><p>And in fact it does much less violence to the structure</p><p>of the sentence if we translate it as</p><p><code>The book is understandable (to me)</code>.</p><p>This is almost what the Japanese is saying.</p><p>The book is the subject and it&#39;s the book that&#39;s actually doing the action.</p><p>The reason <code>The book is understandable to me</code></p><p>is not a perfect translation is because, as you can see,</p><p>this is not in fact an A-is-B sentence.</p><p>So we shouldn&#39;t be saying</p><p><code>The book is understandable (to me).</code></p><p>What we have to say to get the Japanese right is</p><p><code>The book <strong>does</strong> understandable (to me).</code></p><p>And of course that makes no sense at all in English because in English <code>being understandable</code> is regarded as a state.</p><p>But in Japanese it&#39;s regarded as an action, what we might call a <code>stative action</code>,</p><p>a being-kind of action, like <code>being</code> itself.</p><p>Even in English we can say that something <code>exists</code>.</p><p>But generally speaking, English requires things</p><p>to be jumping about doing something in order</p><p>to say that they&#39;re taking any kind of action.</p><p>But in Japanese the action of existing in particular states is often expressed by a verb.</p><p>And this is important because it extends to a whole range of Japanese words, to できる</p><p>and to any verb which has the potential helper attached.</p><p>So if we say <code>日本語ができる</code></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>it gets translated as <code>I can do Japanese</code> or <code>I can speak Japanese</code>, which is even stranger</p><p>because there&#39;s no <code>speak</code> in there and what it&#39;s actually saying is that</p><p><code>Japanese is possible (to me)</code>, but again this is an A-is-B construction</p><p>when in fact this is really an A-does-B sentence.</p><p>What it&#39;s saying is <code>Japanese <strong>does</strong> possible (to me)</code>.</p><p>Now, this may seem like a bit of a quibble, but</p><p>it&#39;s not a quibble because the particles, the structure,</p><p>the entire framework of the sentence is different.</p><p>And in simple sentences like this it may not be very important</p><p>but as sentences become more complicated, this whole issue becomes more important</p><p>because we start to run into sentences that are quite impossible to understand</p><p>unless we recognize what their actual structure is.</p><hr><p>And there is a whole range of verbs that refer to what in English would be called states.</p><p>And in these cases the English translations are always passive.</p><p>And they have to be passive, because there really isn&#39;t a way, another way of saying them in English.</p><p>For example, <code>乱れる</code> -- to be scattered or disordered;</p><p><code>欠ける</code> -- to be chipped or damaged or insufficient;</p><p><code>映る</code> -- to be reflected or projected.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Each of those, as you see, I&#39;ve translated with the English passive</p><p>because it&#39;s the only way to translate them into natural English.</p><p><strong>But they&#39;re not in fact passive in Japanese.</strong></p><p>These are regarded as actions done by</p><ul><li><p>the thing which is disordered,</p></li><li><p>the thing which is damaged,</p></li><li><p>the thing which is reflected.</p></li></ul><p>So if there&#39;s no alternative to translating them</p><p>as passive, aren&#39;t we justified in doing so?</p><p>And the answer to that is, yes of course we are absolutely justified in doing so if what we&#39;re trying to do is tell someone who doesn&#39;t know Japanese and isn&#39;t learning Japanese what is being said or, more accurately, what would be being said by an English speaker in the same circumstance.</p><p>But if, as learners of Japanese, we don&#39;t know what the sentence is actually doing,</p><p>we&#39;re going to get ourselves into an awful tangle.</p><p>We&#39;re going to look at sentences and wonder what they mean and if we try to make our own sentences we just won&#39;t be able to do it because we&#39;ll be looking for passive constructions, we&#39;ll be trying to build sentences according to principles that we haven&#39;t been introduced to and don&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>So the thing to understand here is that in Japanese verbs can and often do represent</strong></p><p><strong>what in English can only be expressed as either states of being or passive actions.</strong></p><hr><p>And then there is another group of verbs which is closely related in type to this in which</p><p>they get translated as <code>becoming</code> a particular thing:</p><p><code>濡れる</code> -- to become wet;</p><p><code>濁る</code> -- to become cloudy or muddy.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Again, in Japanese this isn&#39;t talked about as <code>becoming</code> anything.<br> It&#39;s simply an action in itself.</p><p>If we wanted to find a way of putting it in English</p><p>we&#39;d have to invent a word like <code>muddify</code> or <code>cloudify</code> or <code>wetiniflicate</code>,</p><p>but in fact of course these words don&#39;t exist in English.</p><p><strong>And the key to understanding them in Japanese is not to try to translate them into English but to see how they&#39;re actually working in the Japanese</strong></p><p><strong>and to be aware that one-for-one translations are not possible in these cases.</strong></p><p>And these becoming words like <code>濁る</code> or <code>濡れる</code> can also be used in the continuous present to get us back to our passive states that we had with the other words.</p><p>So, say, <code>濁ている</code>: we&#39;re saying what in English can only be translated as to <code>be cloudy</code>,<br> but in Japanese, again, it&#39;s to <code>exist in a state of cloudiness</code>.</p><p>So this is quite a simple and straightforward issue, but it&#39;s very important<br> that we absorb and understand this principle or we&#39;re going to have a lot of trouble</p><p>with a whole range of Japanese expressions..</p>',121),l=[h];function g(u,b,w,m,y,f){return a(),t("div",null,l)}const k=e(c,[["render",g]]);export{_ as __pageData,k as default};
