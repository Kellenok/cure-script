We&#39;re not visiting the physical building.</strong></p><p>And just as a little sidenote,</p><p><strong>you might sometimes encounter expressions like <code>さくらんち</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>This is a very common abbreviation for <code>さくらのうち</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>So this really actually gives us the basis for all the other meanings of <code>うち</code>,</strong></p><p>whichever kanji it&#39;s written with:</p><p><strong>this notion of a spiritual interior, an enclosure, defined, as it were, by its contents.</strong></p><h2 id="うち-as-meaning-me-私-etc" tabindex="-1">うち as meaning <code>me</code> / 私 etc. <a class="header-anchor" href="#うち-as-meaning-me-私-etc" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;うち as meaning &lt;code&gt;me&lt;/code&gt; / 私 etc.&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, the next time you encounter <code>うち</code> may well be</p><p>when you encounter, in anime or something, a girl who&#39;s <strong>using Kansai-ben</strong>,</p><p><strong>and typically she will say <code>うち</code> instead of <code>私</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>So <code>うち</code> can mean <code>me</code>, particularly feminine,</strong></p><p><strong>particularly the Kansai dialect, although it&#39;s not restricted to that.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And this is very interesting because it&#39;s rather similar to when</strong></p><p><strong><code>こちら</code> is used to mean <code>me</code>;</strong></p><p><strong>again, what <code>こちら</code> means is <code>this side (the side that includes me)</code>.</strong></p><p>And this really has to be understood</p><p>in the light of the fact that</p><p><strong>the distinction between the individual and the family or group to which an individual belongs</strong></p><p><strong>is much less marked in Japanese than in Western culture</strong></p><p><strong>and in the past was even less marked than it is now.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>When Japanese people talk about,</strong></p><p><strong>say, <code>my little sister</code>, generally speaking they won&#39;t say <code>僕の妹</code> or <code>私の妹</code>.</strong></p><p>They would tend to say <code><strong>うち</strong>の妹</code></p><p>(the little sister of <strong>our house</strong> / the little sister of <strong>our family</strong> / the little sister of <strong>our group</strong>).</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And even <code><strong>うち</strong>のきょう</code>, which is</p><p><code>the religion of <strong>our house</strong>, <strong>our family</strong>, <strong>our group</strong></code>,</p><p><strong>because religion is still to a large extent regarded in Japanese as something inherited, something part of one&#39;s family group,</strong></p><p><strong>rather than an individual decision or commitment.</strong></p><h2 id="うち-vs-そと" tabindex="-1">うち vs そと <a class="header-anchor" href="#うち-vs-そと" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;うち vs そと&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Now, from this we get a very fundamental distinction in Japanese,</strong></p><p><strong>which is between the concepts of <code>うち / 内</code> and <code>そと / 外</code>.</strong></p><p><strong><code>うち</code> refers to the group one belongs to, the in-group;</strong></p><p><strong><code>そと</code> refers to everything outside that group.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And this has wide-ranging implications for Japanese culture</p><p>and also for the Japanese language.</p><hr><p><strong>For example, words like <code>くれる</code> and <code>あげる</code>, which are generally</strong></p><p><strong>explained to mean giving something up from oneself or</strong></p><p><strong>receiving something down to oneself,</strong></p><p><strong>is not strictly limited to the self.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>It&#39;s actually referring to the <code>うち</code>, which could</strong></p><p><strong>be oneself but could also be the group to which one belongs.</strong></p><p><strong>So, when we talk about someone <code>くれる</code>-ing to one&#39;s sister or one&#39;s friend</strong></p><p><strong>this is because we regard the sister or the friend as part of our <code>うち</code>,</strong></p><p>therefore it&#39;s giving down to <code>us</code>.</p><p><strong>And you&#39;ll sometimes see <code>くれる</code> used even where</strong></p><p><strong>there is no strict connection between the speaker and the person receiving,</strong></p><p><strong>but if the speaker is identifying with that person, regarding them at this point</strong></p><p><strong>at least as more <code>うち</code> than <code>そと</code> then <code>くれる</code> is appropriate.</strong></p><hr><p>So we can see that this whole concept of <code>うち / そと</code>,</p><p>which has wide-ranging cultural implications which I won&#39;t go into,</p><p>also has implications for the grammatical structures we use.</p><h2 id="うち-used-to-define-a-group-that-x-is-a-part-of" tabindex="-1">うち used to define a group that x is a part of <a class="header-anchor" href="#うち-used-to-define-a-group-that-x-is-a-part-of" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;うち used to define a group that x is a part of&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, developing from this,</p><p><strong><code>うち</code> can be used to define a group of which anything is a part.</strong></p><p>So we can say <code>多くの<strong>うち</strong>から選ぶ</code>,</p><p>which means <code>choose from a large number</code> or, strictly speaking,</p><p><code>choose from <strong>a group consisting</strong> of a large number</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>So <code>うち</code> here refers to the group from which one&#39;s choosing.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And it can become a little more abstract than that.</strong></p><p><strong>It can be referring to an <code>うち</code> of time, an enclosure of time,</strong></p><p><strong>and again, an enclosure defined by its contents.</strong></p><p>So, we might say <code>温かい<strong>うち</strong>に食べる</code>, which means <code>eat it <strong>while</strong> it&#39;s warm</code>.</p><p><code>Eat it <strong>while</strong> it&#39;s hot</code>, as we&#39;d say in English.</p><p><code><strong>温かいうち</strong></code> is that <code>うち</code>, <strong>that enclosure, that period, during which the food is warm.</strong></p><p>So <strong>it&#39;s an enclosure defined by its contents, like the other kinds of <code>うち</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>When does the <code>うち</code> end? It ends when the food stops being warm.</strong></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Similarly, <code>若い<strong>うち</strong></code> (<strong>while</strong> one is young) --</p><p>one should do this, do that, <strong>while</strong> one is young.</p><p><strong>The <code>うち</code>, the enclosure of time, is defined by its contents.</strong></p><p><strong>While</strong> one is young, one is in the <code>若い<strong>うち</strong></code>.</p><p><strong>When one ceases to be young, that&#39;s where the limits of the enclosure lie.</strong></p><h3 id="今のうち" tabindex="-1">今のうち <a class="header-anchor" href="#今のうち" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;今のうち&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And <strong>this can extend to usages that can be a little confusing at first.</strong></p><p>So, for example, <code><strong>今のうち</strong></code>, which is a phrase you&#39;ll often hear in anime and such.</p><p>For example, when an enemy is disabled and now is the time to do the</p><p>magical purification, somebody might shout <code><strong>今のうち</strong>!</code></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And what that means is literally</p><p><code><strong>in the house of now</strong> / <strong>in the enclosure of now</strong></code>.</p><p><strong>It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean <code>this absolute instant</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>but it does mean <code>while now continues</code>.</strong></p><hr><p>What does <code>now</code> mean in this case?</p><p>Well, <strong><code>now</code> means the situation as it is at present,</strong></p><p>in this case, <strong>while</strong> the villain is still purifiable,</p><p><strong>while</strong> he&#39;s disabled, <strong>while</strong> we can actually do what we need to do.</p><p>It could mean, <strong>while</strong> we&#39;re still able to run away.</p><p>It could mean, <strong>while</strong> the Great Door still hasn&#39;t closed.</p><p>In other words, <code><strong>今のうち</strong></code> is</p><p><code><strong>while the circumstances that prevail at the moment continue to prevail</strong></code>.</p><p><strong>Once they cease to prevail, you will no longer be <code>今のうち</code>.</strong></p><h3 id="そのうち" tabindex="-1">そのうち <a class="header-anchor" href="#そのうち" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;そのうち&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And another one that can seem confusing is <code>そのうち</code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <strong><code>そのうち</code></strong> is translated as meaning, and does mean,</p><p><strong><code>sooner or later / at some time in the future / it will eventually happen / by and by</code>.</strong></p><p>So why does <code>そのうち</code> mean that?</p><p>To understand this, we not only have to understand <code>うち</code></p><p>but we have to understand a little bit more about <code>その</code>.</p><h4 id="what-does-その-mean" tabindex="-1">What does その mean <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-その-mean" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What does その mean&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Now, I&#39;ve made a video <em>(Lesson 75)</em> in which I explain</p><p>various things about the use of <code>その</code> in Japanese.</p><p><strong>It very often replaces what in English would be pronouns.</strong></p><p>So if we say <code>さくらと<strong>その</strong>犬</code>, we&#39;re <strong>not</strong> saying <code>Sakura and that dog</code>.</p><p>We&#39;re saying <code>Sakura and <strong>her</strong> dog</code>.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><code>その</code> often implies something related to what we&#39;re talking about.</strong></p><p><strong>And it&#39;s one of the strategies that&#39;s used</strong></p><p><strong>in view of the fact that Japanese doesn&#39;t use pronouns all that often.</strong></p><hr><p>A somewhat more abstract usage is, for example,</p><p>in a dictionary definition like <code><strong>立ち会う</strong></code>, which means</p><p><code><strong>be in a place as a witness</strong></code>, and the Japanese definition is</p><p><code>証人として<strong>その</strong>場に出る</code> which means</p><p><code>as a witness, appear in <strong>that</strong> place, come out in <strong>that</strong> place</code>.</p><p><strong>But what does <code>that place</code> mean in this situation?</strong></p><p><strong>What is <code>その</code> actually being used to mean?</strong></p><p><strong>It means simply whatever place it is, the place appropriate to the current situation.</strong></p><h4 id="so-what-does-そのうち-mean" tabindex="-1">So, what does そのうち mean? <a class="header-anchor" href="#so-what-does-そのうち-mean" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;So, what does そのうち mean?&quot;">​</a></h4><p>And <strong>this is the kind of <code>その</code> that&#39;s being used in <code>そのうち</code>.</strong></p><p><strong><code>そのうち</code> means during the enclosure of time that is appropriate</strong></p><p><strong>to whatever we&#39;re talking about (it will happen).</strong></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><code>そのうち</code> means it will happen within a period of time</strong></p><p><strong>that&#39;s reasonable for it to happen in,</strong></p><p>which may seem a little vague, but it&#39;s no vaguer than the equivalent English expressions</p><p>like <code>one of these days / sooner or later / before long</code>.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s a little bit more specific in that it does tend to imply</strong></p><p><strong>a time that&#39;s not too late for it to be of any use.</strong></p><p>So this is really how <code>うち</code> extends its meaning from quite specific ones</p><p>to more and more abstract ones, all of which are closely related to the fundamental meaning.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p><strong>If you came this far then I thank you and you are awesome!</strong></p><p><em>Thus, we have reached the end at last… took me roughly 1.5 years to edit so I will get some rest soon, made it just in time for 2024:D Though I will yet need to update 26-78 I guess later.<br> Quite a journey indeed I guess (*^ω^)八(⌒▽⌒)<br> Dolly has 204 videos in total so there are still around 100-ish videos, but alas that is beyond the scope of my energy currently, I may add some videos from time to time if I feel like it if I find a good way to copy the subs and all (these 97 lessons were here before I became an editor).</em></p><p><em>I would like to add some of Dolly’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhEnMieHtec&amp;list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_iLm90ie4ewro0lFedXncO&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong><strong>immersion videos</strong></strong></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rT1zaHSmog&amp;list=PLg9uYxuZf8x-W5kcce4zVNwK_JHjxHK5x&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong><strong>vocabulary / kanji acquisition videos</strong></strong></a> especially, since I feel they are very useful.
