The simple logic behind them.</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to discuss <code>ことにする</code> and <code>ことになる</code>.</p><p>Last week we looked at <code>ようにする</code> and <code>ようになる</code> and we briefly recapitulated</p><p>the fact that when we say <code>(something)になる</code> we mean that the thing we&#39;re speaking about turned into whatever is marked by に.</p><p>So if we say <code>さくらはカエルになった</code>, we&#39;re saying Sakura turned into a frog.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If we say <code>にする</code>, we&#39;re saying that someone deliberately turned what we&#39;re talking about into the に-marked noun.</p><p>So, if we say <code>まじょがさくらをカエルにした</code>, we&#39;re saying<br><code>the witch turned Sakura into a frog.</code></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, what about <code>ことにする</code> and <code>ことになる</code>?</p><p>We know that <code>こと</code> means a <code>thing</code>, not a concrete thing like a book or pencil <em>(=もの)</em> but an abstract thing, a situation, or a circumstance. <em>(=こと)</em></p><p>So, if we say <code>けっこんすることにした</code>, we&#39;re saying</p><p>literally: It became the thing of getting married.</p><p>Obviously we have to have a zero-pronoun here,</p><p>because something has to become something.</p><p>So, what&#39;s <code>it</code>?</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Well, <code>it</code> is what it might be in English: <code>the situation / the circumstance</code>.</p><p><code>The circumstance turned into one in which we&#39;re getting married/in which getting married is the thing.</code></p><p>We have to use <code>こと</code> here because, as you know, we can&#39;t attach the logical particle に,</p><p>or any other logical particle, to anything but a noun.</p><p>So, we use <code>けっこんする</code> as the modifier for <code>こと</code> in order to give us a noun of the situation or circumstance of getting married.</p><p>So what does it mean?</p><p><code>We turned the situation into the thing of getting married</code> means <code>We decided to get married</code> / <code>We brought about a situation in which getting married was the thing</code>.</p><p>And so the textbooks will tell you that <code>ことにする</code> means <code>decide (something)</code>,</p><p>and it&#39;s not quite as simple as that, as we&#39;ll see in a moment.</p><p>However, if we say <code>フランスで留学することになった</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>It became the thing of studying in France</code>, which really means <code>It came about that I am going to study in France</code>.</p><p>The situation turned from one in which I&#39;m not going to study in France</p><p>to one in which I am going to study in France.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now because <code>ことにする</code> is a deliberate act done by whoever is making the decision,</p><p><code>ことになる</code> is taken to imply in many cases a deliberate decision.</p><p>So we can translate this most of the time as <code>They&#39;re sending me to France to study</code> /</p><p><code>It&#39;s been decided that I&#39;m going to France to study.</code></p><p>The thing to notice here, though, is that there&#39;s no actual mention of a decision by anyone,</p><p>and in this case it doesn&#39;t matter if we assume that that&#39;s what it means, because it probably does.</p><p>Some people will say <code>けっこんすることになった</code>, which kind of means &quot;It&#39;s been decided</p><p>that we&#39;re getting married<code> or, more literally, </code>It&#39;s come about that we&#39;re getting married&quot;.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And the reason for saying this is that, even though in this day and age, the people who</p><p>decide that they&#39;re getting married are almost always the people who are actually getting married, it sounds a little less forceful, a little less ego-centered,</p><p>not to say <code>we&#39;ve decided...</code> but just to say <code>It&#39;s been decided...</code> or <code>It&#39;s come about...</code></p><p>And I have to say that sounds a little bit more pleasant to me as well,</p><p>but I&#39;m just an android, so what do I know?</p><p>However, we may also say <code>たいへんなことになった</code>, and what that means is</p><p><code>It became -- the situation became -- a terrible thing</code>.</p><p>And this does not carry any implication that anybody decided it ought to be a terrible thing.</p><p>It does not imply a decision, and there&#39;s no reason it would, because there&#39;s no mention</p><p>of decision anywhere in <code>ことにする</code> or <code>ことになる</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In many cases a decision is implied, but in cases like this -- and there are many times when you&#39;ll see <code>ことになる</code> working in this way -- all it&#39;s telling us is that the situation came about, not that anybody decided that the situation should come about.</p><p>So this is why it&#39;s important to learn structure in Japanese, because if we just get a handful</p><p>of Japanese and a handful of English thrown at us -- <code>ことになる</code> means <code>it is decided</code></p><p>-- well, sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn&#39;t.</p><p>The important thing to know is what&#39;s actually going on in the sentence.</p><p>Then we can make a sensible assessment ourselves of what&#39;s being said when we see it in</p><p>an anime or a book or in conversation.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p
