isn&#39;t</code> means <code>it is</code>: mysteries of じゃない janai, ではない de wa nai</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about something that puzzles many learners of Japanese, especially</p><p>once they&#39;ve learned a little Japanese and they start reading Japanese or listening to anime etc.</p><p>And this is the fact that Japanese people often make what appear to be negative statements when they may mean in fact a positive statement.</p><p>For example, someone may say <code>さくらじゃない</code>, which would appear to mean <code>That isn&#39;t Sakura.</code></p><p>But its actual meaning is <code>That is Sakura, isn&#39;t it?</code> or even simply <code>That is Sakura</code>.</p><p>Now, how does this work, how do we recognize it, and how do we understand it?</p><p>For a start, <code>じゃない</code> is the contraction of <code>ではない</code> which, of course, is the negative of the copula, as we learned right back in our lesson on Japanese negatives.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, <code>A,Bだ</code> or <code>A,Bです</code> means <code>A is B</code>.</p><p><code>A,Bではない (or ではありません)</code> means <code>A is not B</code>.</p><p>So there is no question here that we are in fact hearing what is, grammatically, a negative statement.</p><p>So how do we interpret this?</p><p>Well, to begin with, let&#39;s remind ourselves of the fact that negative questions are used</p><p>in most languages, including English, to elicit a positive response.</p><p>So if we say <code>It&#39;s a nice day, isn&#39;t it?</code> we mean that it is a nice day and we expect our hearer to agree.</p><p>If we say <code>Are you Sakura?</code> this is a neutral question.</p><p>We&#39;re not suggesting that we either think it is or it isn&#39;t.</p><p>We&#39;re simply asking the question.</p><p>But if we say <code>Aren&#39;t you Sakura?</code> then we are in fact indicating that we think you are Sakura.</p><p>And a negative question asking for a positive response like <code>It&#39;s a nice day, isn&#39;t it?</code></p><p>is common certainly to all the languages I know.</p><p>In French we have <code>n&#39;est-ce pas</code>, in German we have <code>nicht wahr</code>, and of course in Japanese</p><p>we have <code>ね</code>, which is originally a negative question.</p><p>So if we say <code>さくらじゃないですか</code> we&#39;re saying exactly the same thing as in English</p><p><code>Isn&#39;t that Sakura?</code> meaning we think it is.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The first problem that arises here is that, while we say in formal speech <code>さくらじゃないですか</code> because in formal speech the <code>か</code> acts as a verbal question mark, turning any statement into a question, we don&#39;t usually use <code>か</code> as a question-making sentence-ender in ordinary, non-formal Japanese.</p><p>So what would be <code>さくらじゃないですか</code> in formal Japanese becomes <code>さくらじゃない</code> in regular Japanese.</p><p><code>さくらじゃない</code> has fundamentally three potential meanings. <em>(indicated by tone in speech)</em></p><p>We can say <code>さくらじゃない。</code> -- that means <code>That isn&#39;t Sakura</code>.</p><p>We can say <code>さくらじゃない？</code> and that means <code>That&#39;s Sakura, isn&#39;t it?</code></p><p>But we can also say, perhaps meeting Sakura after quite a long time, <code>さくらじゃない！</code>,</p><p>and that certainly doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t Sakura and it&#39;s not a question either.</p><p>We&#39;ve actually recognized her and what we&#39;re saying is something that could perhaps</p><p>best be rendered into English as <code>If it isn&#39;t Sakura!</code> meaning it is Sakura.</p><p>Now there&#39;s nothing particularly mystical and Japanese about this.</p><p>We do the same sort of thing in English.</p><p>For example, if we said <code>She came on Saturday</code>, that&#39;s simply conveying a piece of information.</p><p>If we say <code>She came on Saturday?</code> we&#39;re asking whether she came on Saturday or not.</p><p>And if we say <code>She came on Saturday?!</code> we&#39;ve just received the information that</p><p>she came on Saturday and we are expressing surprise about it.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We know how to interpret this in English and it&#39;s easy to learn how to interpret <code>じゃない</code></p><p>in Japanese once we understand the range of meaning it possesses.</p><p><code>じゃない</code> gets used with other meanings too.</p><p>Particularly, it gets used as a negative question tag-ending very much like <code>ね</code>.</p><p>For example, we might say <code>暑いじゃない</code><br> which means pretty much the same thing as <code>暑いね</code>.</p><p>It&#39;s something like a tag-question, expecting our listener to agree with us.</p><p>And we can note here that there&#39;s no ambiguity at all in this, because <code>暑いじゃない</code> is not the negative of <code>暑い</code> – that&#39;s <code>暑くない</code>.</p><hr><p>And it can also be put after verbs.</p><p>For example, <code>もう言ったじゃない</code>, which means <code>I already said that, didn&#39;t I?</code></p><p>We should also note that <code>じゃない</code> is often reduced to just <code>じゃん</code> in very colloquial speech, and it&#39;s often used in that way when it&#39;s affirming something or asking for confirmation.</p><p>Now, it&#39;s clear that these expressions are very colloquial and in fact so colloquial</p><p>that when we use them with a verb or an adjective they&#39;re not in fact grammatical.</p><p>And the reason for this, as I&#39;ve already alluded to, is that, for example,</p><p><code>暑いじゃない</code> is not the negative of <code>暑い</code> because that&#39;s <code>暑くない</code>.</p><p>Why can&#39;t we use <code>じゃない</code> with verbs or adjectives?</p><p>Well, that&#39;s because, as we learned right back in the first lesson,</p><p><code>じゃない</code> is in fact <code>ではない</code>, which is the negative of the copula.</p><p>So if we say <code>これはペンだ</code> we&#39;re saying <code>This is a pen</code>; if we say <code>これはペンではない</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>This is not a pen</code>, and you can&#39;t properly use <code>ではない</code> with anything but two nouns.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>I don&#39;t actually think that these colloquial statements are fundamentally ungrammatical.</p><p>It&#39;s just that being colloquial may leave a few steps out of the process.</p><p>There are in fact much more formal ways of using <code>ではない</code> as a positive statement,</p><p>but these of course tidy up the grammar.</p><p>So, for example, if we say <code>その理論が間違っているのではないでしょうか</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>Might that theory not be in error?</code></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And we see we have essentially the same construction that we&#39;ve been dealing with before:</p><p><code>その理論が間違っている... ではない</code>, but that <code>の</code> turns it into a grammatical statement.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because <code>その理論が間違っている</code> means literally <code>that theory exists in a state of mistaking</code>. That&#39;s a verbal clause complete in itself.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>However, when we add <code>の</code>, that <code>の</code>, as we&#39;ve seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq3GO63D9bw&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>other lessons</strong></a>, plays the role</p><p>of a pronoun like <code>thing</code> or <code>one</code> which is being modified by <code>間違っている</code>.</p><p>So now we have <code>that theory exists in a state of error one</code>.</p><p>So we have two nouns and we now need the copula to join them together.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So <code>その理論が間違っているのではない</code> means <code>that theory existing-in-error-one is not</code>.</p><p>The <code>でしょうか</code> doesn&#39;t add anything grammatically to the statement.</p><p>As we know, adjectives like <code>ない</code> stand on their own.</p><p>They don&#39;t require a <code>だ</code>, even though they get a <code>です</code> as a mere decoration, a non-grammatical decoration, in formal speech, so what <code>でしょうか</code> is doing here is it&#39;s simply a flag put at the end of the complete grammatical statement:<br><code>その理論が間違っているのではない</code>.</p><p><code>でしょうか</code> turns it explicitly into a question and into a suggestion rather than a statement.</p><p>So we&#39;re saying <code>Might that theory not be a mistaken one</code>?</p><p>Now, this can mean what it seems to say.</p><p>It can mean that we&#39;re in some doubt and we&#39;re actually asking whether that might not be the case.</p><p>But a lot of the time this is used not just as an assertion but as a quite strong assertion.</p><p>We might use this to sum up our argument when we have definitively disproved the theory in question.</p><p>An American writer or speaker might sum up such an argument with &quot;It is now clear</p><p>to anyone with an intelligence greater than that of a Roomba that this theory holds about as much water as a topless thimble in the Sahara Desert.&quot;</p><p>However, that kind of definite assertion in Japanese is not considered either polite or very persuasive.</p><p>It sounds as if you&#39;re trying to make up for a weak argument by a strong assertion.</p><p>So the equivalent Japanese speaker may sum up the same completely persuasive argument</p><p>with <code>ですからその理論は間違っているのではないでしょうか</code>.</p><p>And that means exactly the same thing, allowing for cultural differences…</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>if anything is still unclear, delving into the comments of the video might be helpful.</p></div>',102)]))}const _=t(m,[["render",u]]);export{k as __pageData,_ as default};
