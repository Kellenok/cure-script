So now let&#39;s move on to <code>もらう</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Kanji is <code>貰う</code>.

And I&#39;ll come to that in just a moment.</p><p>Let&#39;s notice that if no giver is mentioned, then no giver is necessarily implied.</p><p>When a giver is mentioned, the giver is marked by に.</p><p>Now, this is exactly the same as the receptive helper verb <code>-れる/-られる</code></p><p>because <code>もらう</code>, like <code>-れる/-られる</code></p><p>(the receptive, the so-called passive form, which is not passive at all),</p><p>both of them are in fact about receiving, aren&#39;t they?</p><p>So they&#39;re what we might call pull-sentences rather than push-sentences.</p><p>In a push-sentence, the に marks the indirect object, the ultimate receiver of the action.</p><p>So, if we say <code>メアリーにボールを投げた</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I threw the ball at Mary</code>.</p><p>The ball is the <strong>direct</strong> object (what I threw).</p><p>Mary is the <strong>indirect</strong> object (the ultimate receiver of the action).</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In a pull-sentence, where the receiver is the が-marked actor, then the に-marked person</p><p>is the ultimate giver, the ultimate source of the action.</p><p>So it&#39;s actually much more useful to compare <code>もらう</code> to <code>-れる/-られる</code>, the receptive helper, because it does almost exactly the same thing.</p><p>It takes a verb, adds another, helper verb to it which tells us that the action is being received and the actor of the sentence is doing the action of receiving the action from somebody else.</p><p>And this similarity, this likeness, between <code>もらう</code> and <code>-れる/-</code>られる<code></code> is not pointed out</p><p>by conventional Japanese grammar, although it&#39;s really by far the best way of understanding it,</p><p>because of course they confuse the whole issue by calling the receptive <code>-れる/-られる</code> helper <code>passive</code>. It&#39;s not passive, **it&#39;s receptive, just like <em><code>もらう</code></em>**<em>.</em></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Btw. you can’t use both of these receptives at once. Dolly explains in the* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CESFJaFp8FI&amp;lc=UgwTi3XYA1fzqe30n-14AaABAg.8x4VnfQdsss8x57oxMYR66&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>comments</strong></a>.</p></div><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And they work very similarly.</p><p>The difference between them is that <code>-れる/-</code>られる<code></code> implies that the action just happened to us. We may or may not have wanted it, but it wasn&#39;t really our doing.</p><p><code>もらう</code> implies that we took the action, that we actively brought the action upon ourself</p><p>from somebody else; we got them to do it for us.</p><p>So let&#39;s talk about receiving a service.</p><p>A very, very common expression is <code>(zeroが)お医者さんに見てもらう</code> which is translated in dictionaries and English grammars as <code>see a doctor</code>.<br> And this is a terrible, terrible, terrible, irresponsible translation.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>I don&#39;t know why they do this exactly.</p><p>I think it&#39;s because they feel that the likeness to a common English expression makes it easier.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t make it easier, it makes it much harder,</p><p>because it confuses your entire perception of what&#39;s going on here.</p><p><code>お医者さんに見てもらう</code> doesn&#39;t mean <code>I will see a doctor</code>;</p><p>it means <code>I will have a doctor see me / I will get examined by a doctor</code>.</p><p>Now, we can see this much more clearly if we&#39;re talking about hairdressing or a haircut.</p><p><code>さんぱつ/散髪</code> means <code>hairdressing</code> or <code>haircut</code>.</p><p>And if we say <code>散髪をしてもらう</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>have someone cut my hair</code>.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>お医者さんに見てもらう</code> -- <code>have a doctor look at me / examine me</code>.</p><p>So you see the two work in exactly the same way.</p><p>And we can also see that while with <code>お医者さん</code> we&#39;re specifying a giver,</p><p>with <code>散髪をしてもらう</code> -- <code>get one&#39;s hair cut</code> -- we&#39;re not specifying a particular actor.</p><p>Someone might say <code>散髪をしてもらったほうがいい</code> -- <code>you should get your hair cut</code> --</p><p>but it&#39;s not saying anything about by whom.</p><p>It&#39;s not saying whether they want you to go to the hairdresser or</p><p>whether you get your big sister to do it, it doesn&#39;t matter.</p><p>Just <code>get someone to cut your hair</code>.</p><p>And this leads to another very important point, which is that the actor of <code>もらう</code>,</p><p>the person <code>もらう</code>-ing, does not have to be the speaker.</p><p>And by comparing it to <code>くれる</code> a lot of people get very confused by this</p><p>and they get extremely muddled when they see someone</p><p>referring to someone else other than themselves <code>もらう</code>-ing.</p><p>But there&#39;s no rule against this at all.</p><p>You can&#39;t use <code>くれる</code> for someone who isn&#39;t either yourself or a member of your in-group or, for example in a novel, it could be a character</p><p>because the writer is allowed to be inside the head of the character.</p><p>So <code>くれる</code> is tied to a person or an in-group, but <code>もらう</code> is not.</p><p>We can freely talk about other people <code>もらう</code>-ing, receiving something.</p><p>Now, another important area that confuses people terribly,</p><p>but we&#39;re ready to deal with this now, is <code>させてもらう</code>,</p><p>which is a combination of the causative helper verb with <code>もらう</code>,</p><p>and we now know enough about the logic of <code>もらう</code> to deal with this,</p><p>but we&#39;re going to need to learn a little bit more</p><p>about the logic of the causative helper verb <code>-せる/-させる</code>...</p>',127)]))}const I=o(u,[["render",g]]);export{_ as __pageData,I as default};
