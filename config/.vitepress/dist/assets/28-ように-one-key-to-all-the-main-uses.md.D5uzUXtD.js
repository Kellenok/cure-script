It&#39;s easy when you know</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p><em>Today</em> we&#39;re going to talk about <code>ようになる</code>, <code>ようにする</code>, ことにする<code>, </code>ことになる&quot;<em>(nope)</em></p><p>Now, all the elements of these expressions we&#39;ve already learned, so what we need to do now is to see how they fit together in these cases, what they mean, and why they mean what they mean.</p><p>So let&#39;s just do a quick recap of <code>になる</code> and <code>にする</code>.</p><p>As we know, the two primordial Japanese verbs are <code>ある</code> and <code>する</code>.</p><p><code>ある</code> is the mother of all self-move verbs and <code>する</code> is the father of all other-move verbs.</p><p><code>なる</code> is closely related to <code>ある</code> -- <code>ある</code> means <code>be</code>; <code>なる</code> means <code>become</code> --<br> so we can say that <code>ある</code> and <code>なる</code> are the static and dynamic versions of the same verb.</p><p>That is, the same verb being still and moving in time.</p><p>Now, we know that when we use a noun followed by <code>になる</code>, we mean that something turns into that noun.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>に</code> marks the target of the transformation and <code>なる</code> is the transformation itself, the becoming.</p><h2 id="ようになる" tabindex="-1">ようになる <a class="header-anchor" href="#ようになる" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ようになる&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, when we say <code>ようになる</code>...</p><p>Well, we looked at <code>よう</code> last week, didn&#39;t we, and we saw that when we&#39;re comparing things</p><p>or likening things <code>よう</code> means a <code>form</code> or a <code>likeness</code>.</p><p>Its basic meaning is a form or a state of being.</p><p>When we say <code>りきしは山のようだ</code> -- <code>sumo wrestler is like a mountain</code> --</p><p>we&#39;re not saying that the sumo wrestler <code>is</code> a mountain, we&#39;re extracting the form or the state of being of the mountain and applying it to the sumo wrestler.</p><p>We&#39;re not saying that the sumo wrestler is the mountain, we&#39;re saying that the wrestler is the mountain&#39;s <code>よう</code>, the mountain&#39;s form or state of being.</p><p>So in English we say the wrestler is <code>like</code> the mountain; in Japanese we say the wrestler</p><p>is the form or the state of being of the mountain -- we might say, the <code>likeness</code> of the mountain.</p><p>Now, when we use <code>よう</code> in the expressions we&#39;re talking about today, we don&#39;t add them</p><p>to a noun like <code>山</code>, we add them to a complete logical clause.</p><p>The textbooks sometimes say we&#39;re adding them to a verb, but what we&#39;re really doing is</p><p>adding them to a logical clause with a verb-engine.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And <code>よう</code>, as we know, is a noun; the logical clause becomes the adjectival, the descriptor, for that noun, so we know that any verb-engine together with the logical clause it heads can become an adjectival so we&#39;re not saying <code>のよう</code>, we&#39;re NOT saying the likeness of something else here.</p><p>So when we have a logical clause plus <code>ようになる</code>, we&#39;re saying that something became</p><p>or entered the state of being or the form of that logical clause.</p><p>So, for example, if we say <code>彼を信じるようになった</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I came to believe him.</code></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>彼を信じる</code> (or <code>zeroが彼を信じる</code>) --<code>I believe him</code> -- is a logical clause,</p><p>and we&#39;re saying that I moved into the state, I became the state of that logical clause:</p><p><code>I came to believe him.</code></p><p>This is often used with a potential helper verb.</p><p>For example, we might say, <code>日本語のマンガが読めるようになった</code> --</p><p><code>Japanese manga became readable (to me)</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>As you see, in both cases something is changing its state.</p><p>I change my state from not believing him to believing him; the manga changes its state</p><p>from being non-readable to being readable.</p><p>In all cases we are talking about a change of state, a change of the existing state in</p><p>someone or something from one condition to another.</p><p>And if you&#39;re wondering why we most often in Japanese speak of the manga changing state</p><p>from being non-readable to readable rather than speaking, as in English we usually</p><p>do, of the person changing state from not being able to read the manga to being able to read the manga, please watch the video lesson on the potential helper verb where I explain how this works. <em>(Lesson 10)</em></p><h2 id="ようにする" tabindex="-1">ようにする <a class="header-anchor" href="#ようにする" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ようにする&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, when we say <code>ようにする</code> we know that the <code>にする</code> construction is the other-move</p><p>version of the <code>になる</code> construction.</p><p>If we say <code>まじょがさくらをカエルにした</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>the witch turned Sakura into a frog</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So <code>ようにする</code> is to make something enter a state.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t enter it by itself; somebody&#39;s making it enter the state.</p><p>So if we say <code>よく見えるにする</code> -- <code>よく見える</code> means to <code>look good</code>,<br> so <code>よく見えるようにする</code> is to make someone or something look good.</p><p>Now, <code>ようにする</code> has an extended sense, and that is when we say something essentially</p><p>equivalent to <code>please make sure that you do something</code>.</p><p>So, we can say <code>ドアにかぎをかけるようにしてください</code></p><p>and that means <code>please make it so that you lock the door</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And I think you can see the difference here between simply saying<br><code>ドアにかぎをかけてください</code>, which is just <code>please lock the door</code>.</p><p>In one case you&#39;re kind of assuming that the person will simply lock it as a matter of course;</p><p>in the second case you&#39;re making a very special point of it:<br><code>Please make it so that you lock the door (this is important, so please make it be that way)</code>.</p><p><code>It</code> in this case is just the same as it would be in English -- the <code>situation</code>, the <code>circumstance</code> --</p><p>&quot;Please turn the circumstance from one in which you don&#39;t lock the door into one</p><p>in which you do lock the door.&quot;</p><p>So this makes a very special point of this instruction or advice.</p><p>Now, related to this is when you may say something about yourself, usually related to something you do regularly, such as saying <code>毎日歩くようにする</code>.</p><p>And that means literally, <code>[I] (try to) make it so that [I] walk every day</code>.</p><p>But when you put it this way, rather than just saying <code>毎日歩く</code>, which is simply</p><p>saying <code>I walk every day</code>, the implication is that you try to do so.</p><p>You might not necessarily always succeed.</p><p>And, you see, as with the other usage, there&#39;s some doubt as to whether you will do it.</p><p>You don&#39;t say <code>Please make it so that you lock the door</code> unless there is in your mind</p><p>a certain doubt as to whether this is going to happen and you&#39;re trying to make it so that it does.</p><h2 id="ことにする" tabindex="-1">ことにする <a class="header-anchor" href="#ことにする" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ことにする&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When you say it about yourself -- <code>毎日歩くようにする</code> -- there is also another</p><p>factor in play in that when it&#39;s yourself you could also use <code>ことにする</code>, and that</p><p>expresses a firm decision which we&#39;ll talk about next week in the second half of this lesson.</p><p>So if you choose <code>ようにする</code> over <code>ことにする</code> you&#39;re inherently leaving a little room for doubt.</p><p>*************************************************************************************************************</p><h2 id="cause-and-effect-usage-of-ように" tabindex="-1"><code>Cause-and-effect</code> usage of ように <a class="header-anchor" href="#cause-and-effect-usage-of-ように" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;code&gt;Cause-and-effect&lt;/code&gt; usage of ように&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <code>ように</code> can also be used with a clause behind it and a clause in front of it,</p><p>in order to say <code>do one thing in order that another thing may happen</code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The textbooks treat this as if it were a different piece of grammar, a different grammar point,</p><p>but in fact it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s the same as plain <code>ようにする</code>, and the only reason it seems</p><p>a bit different is because we put it a little differently in English.</p><p>But we shouldn&#39;t be thinking about English; we should be thinking about Japanese.</p><p>So let&#39;s take a look at how this works.</p><p>Let&#39;s take a sentence that we&#39;ve already had: <code>よく見えるようにする</code> --</p><p><code>make something (or someone) look better</code>.</p><p>Now, let&#39;s change that to <code>よく見えるように口紅をつける</code> -- &quot;in order that</p><p>she will look better (or I will look better, or someone will look better), apply lipstick&quot;.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, as you see, in English the ways of putting those two ideas are different, and that&#39;s why the textbooks and the conventional explanations talk as if we had two separate, unrelated grammar points.</p><p>But if you look at what&#39;s going on, you can see that they&#39;re actually the same thing.</p><p>In one case we&#39;re saying <code>make someone or something look better</code> without specifying the means.</p><p>We&#39;re just using the neutral, catch-all verb <code>する</code>, which is the fundamental other-move verb.</p><p>When we say <code>よく見えるように口紅をつける</code>,<br><code>口紅をつける</code> is simply replacing the <code>する</code>.</p><p>Instead of unspecifically saying simply <code>make someone look better</code>, it&#39;s saying</p><p><code>do a specific thing in order to make someone look better</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>する</code> is also an action; it&#39;s just an unspecified action.</p><p>It&#39;s just <code>do/act/make something happen</code>.</p><p><code>口紅をつける</code> specifies what that <code>する</code> might be in a particular case.</p><p>So you see, we have exactly the same construction here, not two separate <code>grammar points</code>, as they like to call them.</p><h2 id="ように-at-the-end-of-a-sentence" tabindex="-1">ように at the end of a sentence <a class="header-anchor" href="#ように-at-the-end-of-a-sentence" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ように at the end of a sentence&quot;">​</a></h2><p>And one final note is that you will sometimes hear <code>ように</code> at the end of a sentence,</p><p>usually a ます-ending sentence.</p><p>This is used primarily for prayers and petitions.</p><p>So you might say <code>日本に行けますように</code>.</p><p>And you might say that at a shrine or when you&#39;re wishing on a falling star or perhaps</p><p>just when you&#39;re expressing a wish that a friend might be able to go to Japan.</p><p>Why do we use this?</p><p>Well, obviously it&#39;s a kind of shortening of <code>ようにする</code>.</p><p>If you&#39;re talking to a deity or a fairy, it might be short for <code>ようにしてください</code>.</p><p>So, next week we move on to <code>ことになる</code> and <code>ことにする</code>.</p>',118)]))}const _=o(m,[["render",u]]);export{v as __pageData,_ as default};
