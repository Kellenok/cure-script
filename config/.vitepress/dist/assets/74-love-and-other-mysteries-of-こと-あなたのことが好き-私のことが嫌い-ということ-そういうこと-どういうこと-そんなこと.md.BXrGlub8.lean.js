It avoids any sense of direct physicality</p><p>and it tends to give this whole implication of the gradual blossoming of love</p><p>through the understanding of things about a person.</p><p>This is something that Japanese wants to express commonly enough</p><p>that it has made it a very agile thing to express.</p><h2 id="私のことが嫌い" tabindex="-1">私のことが嫌い <a class="header-anchor" href="#私のことが嫌い" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;私のことが嫌い&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, similarly, we may say things like <code>*(zeroは)*私のことが嫌いらしい</code></p><p>(<code>that person, or those people, appear to find my <strong>こと</strong> dislikeable</code>).</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Why would we say that?</p><p>Well, a lot of the reason, I think, is connected with the way of thinking that also means that<br> we can&#39;t directly express someone else&#39;s emotions,<br> which of course is an actual fact that European languages tend to overlook:</p><p>the fact that we never actually do know someone else&#39;s feelings or emotions.</p><p>Similarly, no one actually knows anybody else directly. We can&#39;t really know another person.</p><p>We can&#39;t know the depths of their being. I&#39;m sure many people watching this assume that</p><p>I&#39;m a human being pretending to be an android.<br> This is how little we can know about any other being.</p><p>So when we&#39;re talking about something deeper that affects our emotions</p><p>rather than simple acquaintance with a person,</p><p>it really makes no sense talking about them being reactions to us.</p><p>They&#39;re not reactions to us; they&#39;re not reactions to our actual being.</p><p>They&#39;re reactions to what they have observed about our conduct, our appearance, our words.</p><p>And that, our <code>こと</code>, is what they may either like or dislike.</p><p>Now, where there isn&#39;t a cultural factor,</p><p><code>こと</code> can in some circumstances be much easier to translate and understand.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, for example, if we say <code>田中さんのこと</code> and we don&#39;t have any particular affection for Tanaka-san, this translates most of the time fairly easily into things like</p><p><code>the matter of Tanaka-san / the affair concerning Tanaka-san</code></p><p>or just <code>the fact that Tanaka-san is a bit of an awkward person to deal with</code>.</p><p>What we actually mean by <code>田中さんのこと</code> will depend on</p><p>what the hearer knows about the history of ourselves and Mr. Tanaka.</p><p>So this really isn&#39;t very difficult at all.</p><h2 id="どういうこと-そういうこと-ということ" tabindex="-1">どういうこと, そういうこと &amp; ということ <a class="header-anchor" href="#どういうこと-そういうこと-ということ" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;どういうこと, そういうこと &amp; ということ&quot;">​</a></h2><p>But a lot of people have asked me to explain expressions like</p><p><code>どういうこと</code> and <code>そういうこと</code>,</p><p>and I&#39;ve touched on these before <em>(Lesson 20)</em>, so I&#39;ll just go over this a little.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>言う/いう</code> and <code>こと</code> in a way belong together, because a <code>こと</code> is a situation, a circumstance, by implication something that actually requires a bit of explanation.</p><p>And the idea of explanation, the idea of expression, and the idea of a <code>こと</code>,</p><p>I think, have always been very close in Japanese.</p><p>That&#39;s why the kun-reading of the kanji that we use in <code>言う</code>,</p><p>the other kun-reading, the one when it&#39;s a noun, is <code>こと</code>. It&#39;s not the same <code>こと</code>,</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Just in case, the Kanji 言 in Kun-yomi can be read as <code>い</code> or as <code>こと</code>, latter of which is usually when it is a noun. In そう言う事, the koto is the 事 Kanji, different one to the 言 - こと.</p></div><p>but as we know if we know much about Japanese and kanji,</p><p>there are often alternative kanji for the same word.</p><p>Now, these aren&#39;t quite the same word, but they are related.</p><p>And this is why we&#39;re always getting expressions like</p><p><code>そういうこと</code>, <code>どういうこと</code>, <code>ということ</code>,</p><p>because a <code>こと</code> is something said, something explained, a situation that requires words.</p><p>So the question <code>どういうこと</code> is one that we often hear.</p><p>It means, in a way, <code>what kind of こと?</code></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And <code>what kind of...</code>, we&#39;re taught in Genki and other textbooks, is <code>どんな</code> in Japanese, and indeed it is, but we tend to use <code>どういう</code> more often in cases where either more explanation might be required or where the explanation would be perhaps a little less expected.</p><hr><p>So, for example, when a character finds herself in a strange situation</p><p>or simply doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on because it&#39;s all very strange and unexpected,</p><p>she&#39;s very likely to say <code>どういうこと</code> -- &quot;what kind of a thing is this?</p><p>In what way explained a situation is taking place or has taken place here?&quot;</p><p>Similarly, when Katrielle Layton solves the case, she says</p><p><code>そういうことでした</code> (<code>So that&#39;s how the situation was explained</code>).</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And it&#39;s thrown into the past tense</p><p>because the idea is that she has solved a mystery that is a standing mystery,</p><p>in other words, this was the explanation all along and she&#39;s just discovered it.</p><p>Now, <code>そういうこと</code> or <code>どういうこと</code> doesn&#39;t have to be something particularly recondite or difficult, but it tends to imply a greater depth of needed explanation than a simple <code>どんな</code>.</p><h2 id="そんなこと" tabindex="-1">そんなこと <a class="header-anchor" href="#そんなこと" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;そんなこと&quot;">​</a></h2><p>On the other hand we do also have <code>どんな</code>&#39;s partner <code>そんな</code> frequently used with <code>こと</code>,</p><p>and in these cases the implication is often that while the <code>こと</code> is relatively</p><p>easily understood or explained, we have some kind of a negative reaction to it.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, that could be denial or it could be protest or disappointment.</p><p>So, for example, if somebody praises us, you may say <code>そんなことがない</code> (<code>that&#39;s not true!</code>),</p><p>because in Japanese it&#39;s polite to reject praise.</p><p>And this is so frequent that</p><p>it&#39;s often reduced simply to <code>そんなこと</code> or even just <code>そんな、そんな</code>.</p><p>So, we&#39;re saying that what you&#39;ve said, this situation which you&#39;re describing about me,</p><p>is not the case: I&#39;m not worthy of this praise.</p><p>And we&#39;ll also often hear characters or people saying simply <code>そんなこと</code> or just <code>そんな</code></p><p>and the implication of this is that what is happening is very unsatisfactory</p><p>or that what someone has said was a bad or unkind thing to say.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, <code>そんなこと</code>, or more often <code>そんな</code>, represents a negative reaction to the situation.</p><p>And it&#39;s interesting in that clearly it&#39;s an unfinished sentence.</p><p>You were going to say something about the <code>そんなこと</code>.</p><p>But unlike many Japanese unfinished sentences, this one, this <code>そんな</code> of protest,</p><p>is so lodged into the language that it&#39;s actually difficult to finish the sentence.</p><p>It&#39;s actually difficult to say what the person might have said</p><p>if they had finished the sentence, because it&#39;s almost never finished.</p><p><code>そんな!</code> has evolved into a protest against the dreadfulness of something all by itself…</p>',128)]))}const q=t(g,[["render",w]]);export{I as __pageData,q as default};
