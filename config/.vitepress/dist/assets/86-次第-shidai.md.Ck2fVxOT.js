Lesson 86</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about one of those words</p><p>that has a huge list of apparently unconnected meanings,</p><p>if you take the English-Japanese dictionary seriously,</p><p>which makes it feel very difficult.</p><p>But as is usual in these cases, the real problem is simply</p><p>trying to fit the square peg of English definition</p><p>into the round hole of Japanese.</p><p>So, if we take a look at the word we&#39;ll be able to understand</p><p>what it really means and how it really works.</p><p><strong>The word is <code>次第</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>According to the dictionary</strong>, it can mean <code>depending on</code>, <code>as soon as</code>,</p><p><code>immediately upon</code>, <code>in accordance with</code>, <code>order</code>, <code>program</code>,</p><p><code>precedence</code>, <code>circumstances</code>, <code>course of events</code>.</p><p><strong>And then we have what the conventional textbooks</strong></p><p><strong>like to call a <code>grammar point</code>: <code>次第に</code>, which means</strong></p><p><strong><code>gradually</code> in the sense of gradually progress into a state.</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, how do we make sense of all this?</p><h2 id="what-is-次第" tabindex="-1">What is 次第？ <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-次第" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is 次第？&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Well, let&#39;s start by looking at <code>次第</code>.</p><p><strong><code>次第</code> is made up of two kanji and it&#39;s a noun.</strong></p><p>And you ought to know that as soon as I say it&#39;s made up of two kanji</p><p>and nothing else, we know that it&#39;s a noun. That&#39;s all it can be.</p><p><strong>And the two kanji are:</strong></p><p><strong>this first one, which is the kanji we use in <code>次</code> (next), and that&#39;s what it means, <code>next</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>And this one, <code>第</code>, which is the Japanese ordinal.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, what&#39;s an ordinal?</p><p><strong>In English, an ordinal is the -st in <code>first</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>the -nd in <code>second</code>, the -rd in <code>third</code>, the -th in <code>fourth</code> etc.</strong></p><p><strong>In Japanese, fortunately, we only have one ordinal for every number</strong></p><p><strong>and it&#39;s <code>第</code>, and we put it before the number, not afterwards.</strong></p><p>So if we want to talk about the third episode of an anime</p><p>we say <code>団三話</code>; so the <code>第</code> is the -rd, the <code>三</code> is the three,</p><p><strong>and <code>話</code> is the counter for stories or episodes.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, we have the <code>次 / つぎ</code> kanji, the <code>next</code> kanji,</p><p>whose regular on-reading is <code>し</code>,</p><p>and we have <code>第 / だい</code>, meaning <code>ordinal / sequence / number in sequence</code>.</p><p><strong>So what it means is <code>next thing in sequence / next thing in order</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>And one more thing we need to know about this word</strong></p><p><strong>is that it generally works by attaching to another noun.</strong></p><p><strong>And this gives us a kind of compound.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>So if we attach <code>時計</code> to <code>腕</code>, <code>腕</code> is telling us about the <code>時計</code>.</strong></p><p><strong><code>腕時計</code> is an <code>arm-clock</code> (a wristwatch).</strong></p><p>If we attach <code>砂 / すな</code> to <code>時計</code> then we have a <code>sand-clock</code> (an hourglass) - 砂時計.<br><strong>And similarly we form these noun-compounds</strong></p><p><strong>with <code>次第</code> and whatever it&#39;s attached to.</strong></p><h2 id="次第-as-as-soon-as-or-immediately-upon" tabindex="-1">次第 as <code>as soon as</code> or <code>immediately upon</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#次第-as-as-soon-as-or-immediately-upon" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;次第 as &lt;code&gt;as soon as&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;immediately upon&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>And the simplest use of this is where it replaces</strong></p><p><strong>the English expression <code>as soon as</code> or <code>immediately upon</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, if we say, <code>分かり<strong>次第</strong>お電話します</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying, &quot;<strong>As soon as</strong> (it) becomes known...</p><p>(<strong><code>分かる</code>, become known; literally, do known, do understandable</strong>)...</p><p><strong>As soon as it becomes understandable, I&#39;ll call you.&quot;</strong></p><hr><p><strong>What you see that we have here the い-stem of <code>分かる</code></strong> (do understandable),<br><strong>which is <code>分かり</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>and we&#39;re creating a compound noun, which means</strong></p><p><strong>&quot;next thing in sequence after doing understandable is that I&#39;ll call you</strong> /</p><p><strong>As soon as it becomes understandable, as soon as we know the situation, I&#39;ll call you.&quot;</strong></p><p><em>=分かり次第お電話します</em></p><hr><p><code>食事の用意が出来次第食べる.</code></p><p>So, although <strong>here we actually have a logical clause</strong>:</p><p><code>食事の用意が出来る</code> (preparations for the meal are completed; literally, come out),</p><p><strong>we actually have the stem of できる here, which is <code>出来 / でき</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>and that&#39;s attached to <code>次第</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, &quot;<strong>the next thing in sequence after the preparation&#39;s been completed is eat</strong> /</p><p><strong>As soon as the preparations for the meal are finished, we&#39;ll eat</strong>&quot;.</p><p><em>=食事の用意が出来次第食べる</em></p><h2 id="次第-as-depending-upon" tabindex="-1">次第 as <code>depending upon</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#次第-as-depending-upon" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;次第 as &lt;code&gt;depending upon&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>And from this logic we then get what seems to be</p><p>a completely different idea in English, which is <code>depending upon</code>.</p><p>So we might say, <code>それは<strong>天気次第</strong>だ</code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In English we&#39;d say <code>that <strong>depends on the weather</strong></code>.</p><p>But in Japanese what we&#39;re saying is <code>that <strong>follows directly from the weather</strong></code>.</p><p>And, <strong>as you see, it&#39;s a different way of putting it,</strong></p><p><strong>but it means fundamentally the same thing.</strong></p><p><code>彼の答えは<strong>気分次第</strong>だ.</code> Now, that means <code>his answer <strong>follows directly from his mood</strong></code>.</p><p>In other words, his answer <strong>depends on what mood he&#39;s in</strong>.</p><h3 id="手当たり次第-phrase" tabindex="-1">手当たり次第 phrase <a class="header-anchor" href="#手当たり次第-phrase" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;手当たり次第 phrase&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And a useful phrase to know here is <code>手当たり次第</code>.</p><p><code>手当たり</code> is <code>手</code> (hand) and <code>当たり</code> (touch or contact).</p><p><strong><code>手あたり次第</code> means <code>whatever one can lay one&#39;s hands on / whatever comes to hand</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, <code><strong>手あたり次第本</strong>を読む</code> (I read <strong>whatever book comes to hand</strong>).</p><p>Reading <strong>a book follows directly from hand-touch of a book</strong>, literally.</p><hr><p><strong><code>手当たり次第</code> can be used in all kinds of constructions:</strong></p><p>I eat <strong>whatever comes to hand</strong>; I read <strong>whatever comes to hand</strong>;</p><p>I <strong>throw whatever comes to hand</strong> at the neighbors.</p><p>And, <strong>as you see, it&#39;s the noun-form of this verb (touch) <code>当たる</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>which is <code>当たり</code>, which attaches to <code>次第</code>.</strong></p><h3 id="attaching-次第-to-a-person" tabindex="-1">Attaching 次第 to a person <a class="header-anchor" href="#attaching-次第-to-a-person" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Attaching 次第 to a person&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Another useful trick is that we can attach <code>次第</code> directly to a person.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So if we say <code><strong>あなた次第</strong>です</code>, we&#39;re essentially saying</p><p><code>it&#39;s <strong>up to you</strong> / it <strong>follows directly from you</strong></code>.</p><p><strong>Now, this wouldn&#39;t be expressed in English as <code>depends on</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>and in fact if we wanted to say <code>it all depends on you</code> in Japanese,</strong></p><p><strong>we&#39;d have to use a different kind of construction altogether.</strong></p><hr><p>Within the Japanese meaning spectrum,</p><p><strong>what <code>あなた次第だ</code> means is <code>it follows directly from you</code>:</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s up to you, it&#39;s not up to anyone else, it doesn&#39;t follow from me,</strong></p><p><strong>it doesn&#39;t follow from anybody else, it follows directly from you, it&#39;s up to you.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>The important thing to understand here is that while</strong></p><p><strong>the English meaning spectrum and the Japanese meaning spectrum differ,</strong></p><p><strong>in Japanese terms we&#39;re dealing with the same fundamental idea all the time.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s not a random selection of ideas, the way it looks as if it is</strong></p><p><strong>when you see it in an English-Japanese dictionary.</strong></p><h2 id="次第-as-according-to" tabindex="-1">次第 as <code>according to</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#次第-as-according-to" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;次第 as &lt;code&gt;according to&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>From here we get meanings like <code>according to</code>:</strong></p><p><code>値段は<strong>品次第</strong>で違う</code>, which literally means</p><p><code>the price differs <strong>directly following the goods</strong></code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Now, if the goods are the same, which they usually are in this kind of a construction,</strong></p><p><strong>then it would mean the quality of the goods, just as</strong></p><p><strong><code>天気次第</code> means the quality of the weather, the type of weather,</strong></p><p><strong>and <code>気分次第</code> means the quality of somebody&#39;s mood, the type of mood.</strong></p><p><strong>So, <code>品次第</code> means the type of goods, the quality of goods.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Now, we can still use the <code>depending</code> translation here</strong></p><p><strong>and not the <code>according to</code> translation.</strong></p><p>We could say, <code>The price <strong>depends on the quality</strong> of the goods</code>.</p><p><strong>However, if we use an expression like</strong> <code>身分<strong>次第</strong>に暮らす</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>live <strong>according to</strong> one&#39;s station in life, <strong>according to</strong> one&#39;s means</code>.</p><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>We can&#39;t use <code>depend</code> here in English, but as you see</strong></p><p><strong>as far as Japanese goes it&#39;s exactly the same idea.</strong></p><hr><p><strong><code>身分</code> isn&#39;t quite translatable, but it means one&#39;s position in life, one&#39;s status,</strong></p><p><strong>and it can, particularly in modern times, mean how much money one has.</strong></p><h2 id="次第-as-a-process-a-set-of-circumstances-a-course-of-events" tabindex="-1">次第 as a process, a set of circumstances, a course of events <a class="header-anchor" href="#次第-as-a-process-a-set-of-circumstances-a-course-of-events" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;次第 as a process, a set of circumstances, a course of events&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Now, in some cases,</strong> and this is where it becomes a little more extended,</p><p><strong><code>しだい</code> (next in sequence) can represent the whole sequence.</strong></p><p><strong>So in these cases it can mean things like a process,</strong></p><p><strong>a set of circumstances, a course of events.</strong></p><p>So one might say, <code>それはこんな<strong>次第</strong>だった</code></p><p>(it was this <strong>kind of situation</strong>, it was this <strong>kind of a sequence of events</strong>).</p><h2 id="次第に" tabindex="-1">次第に <a class="header-anchor" href="#次第に" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;次第に&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, we also have what the textbooks would call the <code>grammar point</code>, <code>次第に</code>.</p><p><strong>This is simply the standard practice of taking a noun (<code>次第</code> is a noun)</strong></p><p><strong>and using it adverbially to describe a verb.</strong></p><p><strong>And doing something <code>次第に</code>, in a <code>次第</code> manner,</strong></p><p><strong>is as a sequence of steps or gradually.</strong></p><p>So, <code>チェシャ猫は<strong>次第に</strong>消えた</code></p><p>(The Cheshire Cat disappeared <strong>gradually</strong>).</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Or <code>夜は<strong>次第に</strong>長くなる</code></p><p>(the nights are growing longer, <strong>day by day, step by step</strong>).</p><p><strong>And this always implies a process taking place over time</strong></p><p><strong>either in definite stages or not, but taking place over time, bit by bit.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And because this is put forward as a <code>grammar point</code>, it can be a bit confusing.</strong></p><p><strong>What we need to notice is that not every use of <code>次第</code> that is followed by に</strong></p><p><strong>corresponds to this so-called grammar point.</strong></p><p>The real issue here, which doesn&#39;t tend to get explained, is that<br><strong>when <code>次第</code> is not modified by another noun</strong></p><p><strong>and it&#39;s on its own acting as an independent adverb,</strong></p><p><strong>that&#39;s when it has this meaning.</strong></p><p>So, in the example we saw earlier, <code>身分<strong>次第に</strong>暮らす</code>,</p><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>that isn&#39;t an example of this. It is being used adverbially,</strong></p><p><strong>but what&#39;s modifying <code>暮らす</code> is not <code>次第</code> on its own but the compound <code>身分次第</code>.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>So these are the fundamental uses of <code>次第</code>.</strong></p><p>They seem very different if you look at them through English glasses,</p><p><strong>but if you look at them as they are, I think we can see that</strong></p><p><strong><code>次第</code> works pretty much the same way all the time.</strong></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>',177),y=[f];function b(k,_,v,q,x,A){return s(),t("div",null,y)}const P=o(w,[["render",b]]);export{I as __pageData,P as default};
