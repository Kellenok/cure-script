In English, we can&#39;t get through a moderately complex sentence without using pronouns like <code>it</code>.</p><p>If we&#39;re talking about any kind of an object, from the Andromeda galaxy to an insect, even a moderately complex passage about it is going to contain <code>it</code> over and over again.</p><p>And this is not how Japanese works. In fact, I&#39;m going to say something that may seem unduly radical. I&#39;m going to say that Japanese doesn&#39;t have simple pronouns at all, not in the sense that they&#39;re understood in English and other European languages. Now, that may seem a bit extreme, but let me explain what I mean.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="pronouns-it-i-and-you-in-japanese" tabindex="-1">Pronouns <code>it</code>, <code>I</code> and <code>you</code> in Japanese <a class="header-anchor" href="#pronouns-it-i-and-you-in-japanese" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pronouns &lt;code&gt;it&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;you&lt;/code&gt; in Japanese&quot;">​</a></h2><p>First of all, let&#39;s take the most basic pronoun, <code>it</code>. There is no equivalent word in Japanese to <code>it</code>. Nowhere in Japanese can you find anything that corresponds to <code>it</code> except zero.</p><p>The only way to say what we mean when we say simply <code>it</code> in English is to say nothing or write nothing: to use the zero pronoun.</p><p>Now, you may say that while we accept this, surely there are in fact pronouns.</p><p>After all, most textbooks start off with the pronoun <code>私</code>.</p><p>Almost every basic sentence in a basic textbook is <code>私 this, 私 that, 私 the other</code>.</p><p>And the ones that aren&#39;t are <code>あなた this, あなた that, and あなた the other</code>.</p><p>So, doesn&#39;t Japanese at least have the basic pronouns <code>you</code> and <code>I</code>? And the answer to that is <code>No, not in the European sense.</code></p><p>In the European languages, there is always one basic, simple pronoun that means <code>I</code>.</p><p>It is the ego-pronoun: <code>I</code> in English, <code>ich</code> in German, <code>je</code> in French, <code>yo</code> in Spanish.</p><p>There is no equivalent to this in Japanese.</p><p>There are many ways to say <code>I</code>: 私, 僕, 俺, あたい, わがはい.</p><p>All of them are in fact roundabout ways of referring to oneself.</p><p>When referring to the person you&#39;re speaking to, you can say <code>あなた</code>.</p><p>You can also say: お前, 手前, きさま, 君, and various other things.</p><p>In other words, this basic personal pronoun doesn&#39;t really exist.</p><p>And although we can identify <code>私</code> and <code>あなた</code> as the most basic of them, it still isn&#39;t the same as a European personal pronoun.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Most of the time we don&#39;t use it. All this <code>私 this, 私 that, 私 the other</code> in the textbooks is ridiculously unnatural. Unless we&#39;re trying to stress a particular point, we don&#39;t say this.</p><p>The usual word for <code>I</code> is zero. The usual word for <code>you</code> is either zero or the person&#39;s name.</p><p>None of the words for <code>you</code> that I&#39;ve cited above, including <code>あなた</code>, are used all that often because among other things they&#39;re just not very polite.</p><p>And it&#39;s one of the remarkable things about the textbooks which cause enormous damage to people&#39;s understanding and grasp of Japanese structure by compelling them to stick the -ます helper onto the end of verbs and letting them believe that this is the basic form of verbs, allowing them to believe that adjectives require a copula when they don&#39;t</p><p>(and if you want to know more about the damage that です/ます does to our basic grasp of the language if we learn it before we learn fundamental basic Japanese, I&#39;ve done a video on that and I&#39;ll put a link above my head and in the Comments below) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymJWb31qWI8&amp;t=0s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em><strong>Lesson 17</strong></em></a>).</p><hr><p>The textbooks do this, which is an extremely destructive thing to do, for the reason that, if you go to Japan and don&#39;t use です/ます to people like your teacher, your employer or strangers that you meet, they&#39;ll think you&#39;re rude.</p><p>Now, this is perfectly true, but of course until you&#39;ve got a basic grasp of the language you won&#39;t be saying anything to anybody, and if you are, it&#39;ll be so inept that the last thing they&#39;re going to be thinking about is whether or not you&#39;re sticking です/ます decorations onto the end of your sentences.</p><p>But having caused this damage to the learning of structure by using です/ます, they then proceed to teach you to address people as <code>あなた</code>, which is actually ruder than not using</p><p>です and -ます. If you don&#39;t use です/ます and your Japanese is pretty poor, most people will just assume that you&#39;re like a small Japanese child who doesn&#39;t really know the decorations yet. If you call people <code>あなた</code>, even though they&#39;ll cut you some leeway because you&#39;re foreign, they&#39;ll probably find it difficult not to wince.</p><p>You don&#39;t call your teacher <code>あなた</code>, you don&#39;t call your boss <code>あなた</code>, you don&#39;t call strangers <code>あなた</code>, but even with friends, to whom you don&#39;t need to use です/ます, you don&#39;t call them</p><p><code>あなた</code> either.</p><p>So why do the textbooks, when they actually put your grasp of Japanese structure through the wringer by forcing you to use です/ます too early, then proceed to teach you something far ruder than not using です/ます?</p><hr><p>Well, the reason is that they&#39;re prepared to sacrifice anything in order to structure Japanese as if it were English. In English you use the simple, neutral personal pronoun <code>you</code> all the time, and in Japanese you don&#39;t. But they seem to think you&#39;re too dumb to get that.</p><p>They seem to think that unless Japanese sentences are structured in such a way that they sound unnatural but feel to you like an English sentence,</p><p>with <code>私 this, 私 that, あなた this, あなた that</code>, you won&#39;t be able to grasp it.</p><p>So, Japanese doesn&#39;t have an <code>it</code> and it doesn&#39;t really have a <code>you</code> or an <code>I</code> in the sense that European languages do. What about <code>he</code> and <code>she</code>? At least it has <code>彼</code> and <code>彼女</code>, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Well, <code>彼</code> and <code>彼女</code> were introduced into Japanese in the late Edo and early Meiji era in order to translate nineteenth-century European novels into Japanese. That&#39;s what they were for.</p><p>Since then, they&#39;ve become integrated into the language and they&#39;re used sometimes in everyday speech, but not nearly as much as the zero-pronoun is used.</p><p>For every one time that <code>彼女</code> or <code>彼</code> are used for <code>he</code> or <code>she</code>, there are at least a hundred times when the zero-pronoun is used in that capacity.</p><p>So, what do we do when, for example, we want to express possession?</p><p>Suppose we want to say <code>Sakura and her dog</code>. Now, we could say <code>さくらと彼女の犬</code>.</p><p>That is grammatical Japanese, but it&#39;s not very usual Japanese.</p><p>The usual way of saying it would be <code>さくらとその犬</code>.</p><p>And this word <code>その</code> is very important here.</p><h2 id="その" tabindex="-1">その <a class="header-anchor" href="#その" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;その&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We&#39;re taught, early on <em>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLkY6whr7T4&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Lesson 20</strong></a>)</em>, that it means <code>that</code>, in the sense of <code>that dog</code>, <code>that hat</code>, <code>that country</code>, and it does, but as we&#39;ve learned before, Japanese words very rarely correspond to the exact same part of the meaning spectrum that their supposed English equivalents correspond to.</p><p>If in English we say something like <code>that dog</code> or <code>that tree</code> we mean the one we&#39;re talking about, the one related to the current subject. But in Japanese it goes considerably further than this.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, <code>さくらとその犬</code> means Sakura and a dog related to her, in other words, Sakura and her dog. And this ability of <code>その</code> to express things like possession and relatedness gives rise to a whole range of strategies. But once we understand what it means, they&#39;re much easier to understand.</p><p>So, for example, the simple Sanseido Japanese dictionary defines the word <code>立ち会う</code>, which can&#39;t really be translated into any particular English word because what it means is go to a particular place in the capacity of a witness or act in the capacity of a witness.</p><p>The Sanseido definition is <code>証人としてその場に出る</code> : as a witness, go to that place.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s the nearest we can get in English without getting rather convoluted.</p><p>What does <code>that place</code> mean here? The only way to translate that properly into English would be to say something like <code>as a witness, go to the place which is whatever place is involved at the time – that place, the place to which you go as a witness</code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So this opens up a whole range of uses of <code>その</code> which don&#39;t really have any equivalent in English. <code>その</code> is the related thing, the thing in question at the time, the thing belonging to the person we&#39;re talking about, or whatever, and this gives strategies that are essentially the ones that displace English pronouns.</p><p>And there are various other strategies that displace pronouns.</p><p>For example, we&#39;ve talked in the past <em>(Lesson 48?)</em> about <code>くれる</code> and <code>あげる</code>, and I think we often get the impression that this has a lot to do with a more personal sense of relation.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We&#39;re not just talking about what&#39;s done but whether it&#39;s done as a favor to ourselves, whether it&#39;s done as a favor to someone else, and that kind of thing.</p><p>And that is important too. But also it takes the place of pronouns. If we said <code>教えてくれた</code>, what we&#39;re saying is <code>she taught me</code>.</p><p>We know that someone else did it, because the <code>-てくれる</code> form can only be something done by someone else. We know that they did it to me because <code>くれる</code> means either me or someone within my circle.</p><p>So, we can say <code>教えてくれた</code> . There is no <code>she</code> and there is no <code>me</code> in that sentence, but the form of the sentence tells us what the pronouns would tell us in English.</p><p>Again, if we say <code>殺してやる</code>, it means <code>I&#39;ll kill you</code>.</p><p>And again, it&#39;s the <code>-てやる</code> which gives us both the <code>you</code> and the <code>I</code>.</p><p>And generally speaking, if we use any plain, non-past action referring to the future the default actor is going to be <code>I</code>. If we say <code>今帰る</code>, this means <code>I&#39;m going home now</code>.</p><p>How do we know it&#39;s <code>I</code>? Well, first of all, <code>I</code> is the default, and secondly we&#39;re predicting an action which is in our own minds.</p><p>We can&#39;t predict the actions of others except under special circumstances.</p><p>So unless the context suggests otherwise, this has got to be <code>I</code>: <code>I&#39;m going home now.</code></p><p>And somewhat related to the use of <code>その</code>, we have the use of <code>ある</code>.</p><p>And stories often begin with <code>ある日</code>, and people often wonder why <code>ある日</code>.</p><p><code>ある</code> simply means <code>being</code>.</p><p>Now, as we know, any verb or any verbal clause can modify any noun.</p><p>So why <code>ある日</code>? <code>ある</code> just means <code>exist</code>. So <code>ある日</code> means <code>existing day</code>.</p><p>Now, when a story begins with <code>ある日</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>One day</code>.</p><p>If we say <code>ある国のある村に</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>In a certain village, in a certain country</code> and this is another very usual setting for a story. But we&#39;re not saying <code>a certain</code>, because the expression strategy is different in Japanese from in English.</p><hr><p>In English we say <code> a certain...</code> -- and what do we mean by that?</p><p>Well, we mean that the place is certain. We know where it is, we know what it is, we&#39;re just not telling you. Which, when you think about it, is rather a strange way of putting it. The only reason we really say <code>a certain...</code> is that we want to introduce it without saying anything at all about it.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And Japanese, which is often more logical than English, does that in the most logical way possible. It doesn&#39;t tell us anything about it except the fact that it exists.</p><p>And if it didn&#39;t exist, it wouldn&#39;t be there, there&#39;d be nothing to talk about, so we&#39;re saying the absolute minimum we can say, that it exists.</p><p>Of course, it may not even exist in reality, but it exists in relation to the narrative, so it exists:</p><p><code>ある国のある村には...</code></p><p>And just as a rider to this, I&#39;d like to talk about <code>ある日のこと</code> or even <code>ある国のこと</code>,</p><p>which again can introduce a story.</p><h2 id="のこと" tabindex="-1">のこと <a class="header-anchor" href="#のこと" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;のこと&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Why are we saying <code>のこと</code> here?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s worth remembering that <code>こと/事</code> not only means a situation or a circumstance but is a kind of cousin to the <code>こと/言</code> of <code>言葉</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Check Lesson 74 for this.</p></div><p>A <code>こと</code> is a thing, a circumstance, something that you can&#39;t just see or touch, you need a verbal story or description to convey it.</p><p>So, <code>ある日のこと</code> essentially means the affair of a certain day.</p><p><code>ある村のこと</code> means the affair of a certain village. And we&#39;re saying this to preface the story. We&#39;re saying that what follows will be the affair of a certain day / the affair of a certain village. And because of the kinship to <code>言葉</code>, it has a slight overtone of <code>the story of a certain village / the story of a certain day</code>.</p><p>So, here we have some expression strategies that are very different from English ones, difficult to grasp until we know what they mean, and very difficult to grasp when we&#39;ve been misled into thinking that Japanese expression strategies are much nearer to English ones than they actually are.</p><p><em>Links from comments: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpiELpGR-VU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>The Meaning Spectrum introduced in this video</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymJWb31qWI8&amp;t=0s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>How です・ます (desu/masu) undermines early structural understanding</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLkY6whr7T4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Sono and its&#39; relatives (sono, sonna, sore, konna kono kore etc.)</strong></a></em></p>',107)]))}const J=t(g,[["render",y]]);export{x as __pageData,J as default};
