We usually associate <code>分かる</code> with this kanji,</p><p>but in fact you can write the word <code>分かる</code> with three different possible kanji</p><p>and they all have slightly different implications -- <em>分かる</em>, <em>解る</em>, <em>判る</em></p><p>and I&#39;ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bI_WLm8Jmo&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>written an article</strong></a> <em>(it is a video actually)</em> about that if you&#39;re interested,</p><p>so I&#39;ll put a link in the information section below <em>(what is linked is a video).</em></p><p>The point is that <code>わけ / 分かる</code> is not tied to any one kanji.</p><p>It&#39;s a fundamental Japanese word that goes back further than the kanji used to represent it,</p><p>and the fundamental idea in all these cases is the same:</p><p>the idea of separation, division, analysis, breakdown.</p><p>So, what actually is a <code>わけ/訳</code>?</p><p>Let&#39;s take the most prominent English definitions, which are: cause, reason,</p><p>and conclusion based on something we&#39;ve seen or heard.</p><p>Now, let&#39;s note that cause, reason, and conclusion generally speaking refer to the same thing.</p><p>The main difference is whether the process is going backward or whether the process is going forward.</p><p>Let&#39;s take an example.</p><p>If I say <code>Sakura was out in the rain, and therefore she&#39;s wet</code>,</p><p>we are taking two known facts and stating the causal, the reasoning, connection between the two.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If I say <code>Sakura is wet and therefore I reason that she was out in the rain</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re taking exactly the same piece of reason, the same causality, and working in the other direction.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We&#39;re working from one known fact to another unknown fact that we use the reasoning to arrive at.</p><p>But that piece of reasoning, that causal link, that fundamental underlying reasonality,</p><p>is the same in both statements.</p><p>In one case we&#39;re working it forward, in the other case we&#39;re working it backward,</p><p>but that fundamental underlying causal logical reasonality, to coin a phrase, is the same.</p><p>And I coined the phrase <code>reasonality</code> because there isn&#39;t really a word for this in English.</p><p>But in Japanese there is, and the word is <code>わけ/訳</code>.</p><p>So <code>わけ</code>, as we see, expresses a cause, a reason,</p><p>and a conclusion or a logical judgement -- all of those things.</p><p>What it really expresses is the underlying causality or reasonality,</p><p>and when the dictionaries say that it also expresses a circumstance or situation</p><p>or something like that, in fact it doesn&#39;t really do that,</p><p>but what it does is express the underlying reasonality of a circumstance or a situation.</p><p>And once we understand that, we can start to understand the different ways in which <code>わけ</code> is used.

That&#39;s not what it was</code>.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And, essentially, the dictionaries here say that <code>わけ</code> means a situation or a circumstance</p><p>because they take these statements as being denying the situation or the circumstance,</p><p>but as you see, that&#39;s not exactly what they&#39;re doing.</p><p>They&#39;re not denying the situation or the circumstance,</p><p>they&#39;re denying the underlying reasonality of the situation or the circumstance,</p><p>and in doing that also implicitly denying the situation or the circumstance,</p><p>but that isn&#39;t always the case.</p><p>For example, we might say <code>Just because she&#39;s fat doesn&#39;t mean she eats too much</code> --</p><p><code>食べすぎるわけではない</code>, the reasonality isn&#39;t that she eats too much.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And we may not be saying that she doesn&#39;t eat too much.</p><p>We&#39;re just saying that the fact that she&#39;s fat doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that she eats too much,</p><p>that&#39;s not good reasoning.</p><p>We don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s true or not, but from the fact that she&#39;s fat we can&#39;t say that.</p><p>So, what we&#39;re doing in all these cases is denying a certain rational connection.</p><p>We&#39;re saying that that rational connection doesn&#39;t exist.</p><p>Whether the fact that it implies exists or not isn&#39;t really what we&#39;re talking about here.</p><p>In some cases we&#39;re implying that it doesn&#39;t,</p><p>in some cases we may not be implying anything either way.</p><p>But the important thing that we&#39;re denying is the underlying reasonality,</p><p>the logical link that might be made in these cases.</p><h2 id="わけない-訳ない-訳がない" tabindex="-1">わけない / 訳ない (訳がない) <a class="header-anchor" href="#わけない-訳ない-訳がない" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;わけない / 訳ない (訳がない)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, another common negative use is <code>わけがない</code>, sometimes shortened to just <code>わけない</code>.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>This tends to be strongly denying that something exists at all.</p><p>Again one might think one is denying the situation or the circumstance,</p><p>but what one is denying is the rationality of it.</p><p>Now, how do we tell this from the uses that we saw before?</p><p>Well, let&#39;s notice the structural difference.</p><p>One is <code>x わけではない</code>, that&#39;s to say that the circumstance we&#39;ve talked about</p><p>or are referring to doesn&#39;t have that reasoning.</p><p>This is the simple difference between <code>ではない</code> and <code>がない</code></p><p>that we talked about way back in our lesson on negatives. <em>(possibly Lesson 7)</em></p><p>So, in these cases where we&#39;re saying <code>it doesn&#39;t mean that... / it&#39;s not that... / it&#39;s not as if...</code> etc,</p><p>in other words <code>that reasoning doesn&#39;t apply</code>, here we&#39;re saying that no reasoning exists.</p><p><code>わけがない</code>: <code>there is no reasoning</code>.</p><p>And therefore, since there is no reasoning, since it doesn&#39;t compute, it can&#39;t be the case.</p><p>So, for example, <code>さくらはウソをつくわけがない</code> – <em>Sakura-tell-a-lie reasonality is non-existent</em></p><p><code>Sakura wouldn&#39;t tell a lie</code> -- there&#39;s no way she&#39;d tell a lie.</p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The underlying logic or reasonality of Sakura telling a lie doesn&#39;t exist,</p><p>therefore it&#39;s not possible that she would tell a lie.</p><p>Again, <code>さくらを忘れるわけがない</code> -- <code>I won&#39;t forget Sakura</code> or <code>I won&#39;t forget you, Sakura</code>.</p><p>What we&#39;re saying here really is that the underlying reasonality of forgetting Sakura doesn&#39;t exist.</p><p>There is no reasonality, it doesn&#39;t compute, therefore it can&#39;t happen.</p><h3 id="わけがない-as-there-is-no-reason" tabindex="-1">わけがない as <code>there is no reason</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#わけがない-as-there-is-no-reason" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;わけがない as &lt;code&gt;there is no reason&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, there is another possible meaning for <code>わけがない</code></p><p>and that is in a more direct and literal sense saying simply <code>There&#39;s no reason</code>.</p><p>It&#39;s not to say it&#39;s not happening or it doesn&#39;t exist, but there&#39;s no reason for it.</p><hr><p>So, for example, <code>そんなにお金の要るわけがない</code></p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>there&#39;s no reason she would need that much money</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>since this いる, as per what Dolly says means <code>need</code>, I put 要る in its Kanji form to reflect it, rather than just regular <code>to be</code> 居る/いる.</p></div><p>*Also, this...just in case…<br> *<img src="'+_+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>She might be asking for it, she might get it, but there&#39;s really no reason why she would need it.</p><p>How do we know the difference between these two?</p><p>Well, this is a matter of context, and I&#39;ve done a video on how we deal with this kind of thing.</p><p>We actually do it in English all the time.</p><p>Lots of statements have more than one possible interpretation</p><p>and most of the time we&#39;re not aware of it</p><p>because we are so used to using the context to determine</p><p>which of a possible range of meanings is to be applied in a given case.</p><p>We&#39;re not conscious of this process so we really need to understand it</p><p>in order to apply it in Japanese or any other language.</p><p>So take a look at that video if you haven&#39;t seen it already <em>(Lesson 48)</em>.</p><h3 id="わけがない-as-simple-easy" tabindex="-1">わけがない as <code>simple, easy</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#わけがない-as-simple-easy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;わけがない as &lt;code&gt;simple, easy&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And that might be particularly useful, because there is a third use of this negative <code>わけがない</code>,</p><p>often reduced to just <code>わけない</code>, which is to say that something is simple or easy.</p><p><img src="'+v+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>日本語を話すのはわけがないことだ</code> --</p><p><code>Speaking Japanese is easy, no problem.</code></p><p>Why do we say <code>わけがない</code> here?</p><p>What we&#39;re saying is that there&#39;s really no reasoning needed.</p><p>It can be compared to the English expression <code>no-brainer</code>.</p><p>You might think that meant that something was stupid,</p><p>but what it actually means is that something is so easy or so obvious</p><p>that it doesn&#39;t take any brainwork to arrive at it.</p><p>And this is the use of <code>わけない</code> here.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a no-brainer. Talking Japanese is just simple.</p><p>A cakewalk. Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy.&quot;</p><p>And again, there&#39;s not much chance of misunderstanding or confusing the different uses</p><p>provided you understand the basic rules of disambiguation.</p><p>And provided that most of the time you&#39;re doing it in context, in real Japanese immersion,</p><p>and not in chopped-off bleeding sample sentences.</p><p>So don&#39;t forget: structure is the key to immersion but immersion is the key to Japanese.</p>',215),S=[x];function z(q,j,A,W,T,J){return a(),t("div",null,S)}const N=e(I,[["render",z]]);export{D as __pageData,N as default};
