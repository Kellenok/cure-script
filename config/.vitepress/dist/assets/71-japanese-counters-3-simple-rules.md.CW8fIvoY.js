Lesson 71</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Yomichan or Rikaichamp will be useful here…I made the decision to use Kanji forms mainly, since I feel like it might show the counters a bit better, even if it may be harder to read.</p></div><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about counters in Japanese.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, as we all know, the textbooks like to present</p><p>Japanese as a kind of mysterious language</p><p>full of completely random and irrational rules</p><p>and items that we just have to learn</p><p>because there&#39;s no particular reason for them.</p><p>And, as you all know if you&#39;ve been following my video lessons,</p><p>most of the time this isn&#39;t true.</p><p>Most of what goes on in Japanese is completely reasonable and logical</p><p>if you just know how it works,</p><p>which the people who write textbooks don&#39;t appear to.</p><p><em>(or rather they know, but simplify it for bilingual learners, since they are just textbooks…)</em></p><p>However, counters might seem like an exception to this rule.</p><p>There are a lot of them. An awful lot of counters.</p><p>In Japanese you can&#39;t just say <code>one dog</code> or <code>two flowers</code> or <code>three birds</code>.<br> You have to use a counter.</p><p>So we say <code>一匹の犬 / いっぴきの犬</code> -- <code>one dog</code> -- and the counter here is <code>匹 / ひき</code>,</p><p>which gets pronounced <code>ぴき</code> in this particular instance. <em>(It is a counter for small animals)</em></p><p>For <code>three birds</code> we say <code>三羽の鳥 / さんわの鳥</code>, and the <code>羽 / わ</code> is a counter <em>(for birds…)</em>.</p><p>So it looks as if we have to learn an awful lot of counters, doesn&#39;t it,</p><p>just to say what in English you can say by the number and the thing.</p><p>And there really are a lot of counters -- dozens and dozens of them <em>(actually, hundreds (″ロ゛)</em>.</p><p>So this looks like a problem, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p>But it&#39;s not, in fact, nearly as much of a problem as it appears to be.</p><p>First of all, although there are an awful lot of counters,</p><p>only about a dozen of them are really commonly used <em>(Thank ye, Lord Dio…ε=ε=┌(;￣▽￣)┘)</em>.</p><hr><p>Secondly, most of the time we can avoid them by using</p><p>the native Japanese counting system, which doesn&#39;t require counters.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So if we use the <code>一つ, 二つ, 三つ, 四つ, 五つ</code> counting system, we don&#39;t need any counters.</p><p>We can use them for nearly everything --</p><p>not people, not small animals, but practically everything else</p><p>we can use the Japanese counting system if we want to.</p><p>So the important thing here, as I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be surprised to hear me say,</p><p>is that what we&#39;re not going to do is start learning lists of counters.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That, if you&#39;ll excuse the expression, would simply be counterproductive.</p><p>And there are several reasons why we don&#39;t need to.</p><h2 id="memorizing-counters-is-not-necessary" tabindex="-1">Memorizing counters is not necessary <a class="header-anchor" href="#memorizing-counters-is-not-necessary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Memorizing counters is not necessary&quot;">​</a></h2><p>First of all, in terms of understanding Japanese,</p><p>they don&#39;t present many problems at all.</p><p>If we hear someone saying a number and a thing we know,</p><p>if there&#39;s a little word in between the two, we know it&#39;s a counter.</p><p>So we know what they&#39;ve said.</p><p>If they say <code>一輪の花</code>, we know they&#39;re saying <code>one flower</code>.</p><p><code>一... 花</code>, and the <code>輪 / りん</code> must be the counter. <em>(輪 / りん, counter for wheels &amp; flowers)</em></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If we hear someone saying <code>二羽の鳥</code>, we know that they&#39;re saying <code>two birds</code>:</p><p><code>二... 鳥</code>, and the <code>羽</code> is the counter.</p><p>If we hear someone saying <code>三匹の猫 / さんびきの猫</code></p><p>-- now, even if we knew <code>匹 / ひき</code>, but we didn&#39;t know that at three it becomes <code>びき</code>,</p><p>that&#39;s not a problem because we know <code>三</code>, we know <code>猫</code>,</p><p>and we know that things that come between numbers and their object are going to be counters.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Should we put them into our Anki?</p><p>Yes, we should. We&#39;ll get to know them over time. But we don&#39;t have to fret about learning them.</p><p>And as I&#39;ve indicated, the counters aren&#39;t pronounced the same way all the time,</p><p>and that&#39;s much less of a problem than it appears to be if we understand how it works.</p><p>And I&#39;m going to talk about that towards the end, but it&#39;s not really terribly important.</p><p>It&#39;s actually much more important to understand how they work structurally.</p><p>There are two ways of using counters,</p><p>and it&#39;s the second of those ways that I think often confuses foreigners.</p><h2 id="two-ways-of-using-counters" tabindex="-1">Two ways of using counters <a class="header-anchor" href="#two-ways-of-using-counters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Two ways of using counters&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The first way, actually, is quite similar to English.</p><p>So when we use <code>匹 / ひき</code> for animals or <code>枚 / まい</code> for sheets of paper, shall we say,</p><p>it&#39;s not that dissimilar to saying <code>five heads of cattle</code> or <code>a dozen sheets of paper</code> in English.</p><p>Not quite the same thing, but it&#39;s very similar.</p><h3 id="the-second-use" tabindex="-1">The second use <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-second-use" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The second use&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The usage that confuses people is when we say things like <code>猫が五匹います</code> <em>(count. read ひき)</em>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And that would be translated as <code>There are five cats</code>, and that is how we&#39;d say it in English.</p><p>In Japanese we&#39;re saying something a little different.</p><p>And to understand the structure, we need to understand that.</p><p>So, first of all, what kind of a word is a counter?</p><p>What part of speech does it represent?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s not a verb and it&#39;s not an adjective.</p><p>It&#39;s not a particle and it&#39;s not a conjunction.</p><p>So, nine times out of ten, what is a word if it&#39;s not a verb or an adjective</p><p>or a particle or a conjunction?</p><p>What is it? It&#39;s a noun!</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Nearly always it&#39;s a noun, and that is true of counters.</p><p>Counters are nouns. That&#39;s why we use の after them.</p><p>We say <code>一輪の花</code>, <code>三匹の猫</code>, just as we would with any other noun:</p><p><code>魔法の杖</code> -- <code>magic wand</code>; <code>三匹の猫</code> -- <code>three cats</code>.</p><hr><p>But when we say <code>猫が三匹いる</code> -- <code>there are three cats</code> in English</p><p>-- what are we actually saying? --</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Well, the thing to understand here is that counters aren&#39;t ordinary nouns.</p><p>They are what I called in my video about special noun types <em>(Lesson 41)</em>,</p><p>they&#39;re what I called <code>foxy nouns</code>, that is to say, adverbial nouns.</p><p>They are nouns that have the special property of being able to modify verbs.</p><p>And that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here.</p><p>When we say <code>猫が三匹います</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re actually saying <code>cats, three-small-animals-ly exist</code>.</p><p>Now, that&#39;s very difficult in English, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>We could make it sound a little bit simpler by saying</p><p><code>cats three-ly exist</code> or <code>cats exist threefold-ly</code>,</p><p>but in fact because of the counter system we&#39;re saying <code>cats exist three-small-animals-ly</code>.</p><p>We&#39;re describing the way they exist.</p><p>They exist in a three-small-animals way.</p><p>If there were four of them, they&#39;d be existing in a four-small-animals way.</p><p>And that&#39;s why sentences like that have to end in a verb.</p><p>The verb modified by a counter is often, as in this case, the verb of being,</p><p>but it doesn&#39;t have to be. For example, we might say</p><p><code>写真を三枚取った</code> -- <code>I took photographs three-flat-things-ly</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And while that&#39;s very different from the way we put it in English,</p><p>it&#39;s useful and important for the structure to understand that</p><p>that is in fact what&#39;s happening in the Japanese.</p><p>Now, what about learning the counters and learning the sound-changes of the counters,</p><p>which really tends to worry people.</p><hr><p>Now, as I said, we don&#39;t need to learn lists of counters.</p><p>We&#39;ll pick up counters as we go along in our Japanese immersion.</p><p>When we encounter a new counter in our reading or our Japanese-subtitled anime,</p><p>we can put it into our Anki and we&#39;ll gradually build up our stock of counters.</p><p>The counters that are commonly used are not that huge in number.</p><p>We have <code>枚</code> for flat things like sheets of paper or coins.</p><p>We have <code>本</code> for long round things, <code>冊</code> for books.</p><p>That might seem strange because why do we have <code>冊</code> for books</p><p>and <code>本</code> for long round things, when <code>本</code> actually means <code>book</code>?</p><hr><p>Well, that&#39;s because when the word <code>本</code> first came into being and meant,</p><p>among other things, a book, at that time books were long round things. They were scrolls.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So a book was counted in the way that other long round things were counted.</p><p>But later on, when books became flat things with pages, the counter was changed to <code>冊</code>.</p><p>So, we probably need a dozen or so counters for everyday use</p><p>and we&#39;ll pick those up reasonably quickly.</p><h2 id="the-sound-changes-for-counters" tabindex="-1">The sound changes for counters <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-sound-changes-for-counters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The sound changes for counters&quot;">​</a></h2><p>But what about all the sound changes?</p><p>Let&#39;s take <code>匹 / ひき</code>, which is the counter for small animals.</p><p>We say <code>いっぴきの猫</code> -- one cat, <code>にひきの猫</code> -- two cats; <code>さんびきの猫</code> -- three cats;</p><p><code>よんひきの猫</code> -- four cats; <code>ごひきの猫</code> -- five cats; <code>ろっぴきの猫</code> -- six cats;</p><p><code>ななひきの猫</code> -- seven cats; &quot;はっぴきの猫 -- eight cats;</p><p><code>きゅうひきの猫</code> -- nine cats; <code>じゅっぴきの猫</code> -- ten cats.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>よんひき in Kanji looks interesting 😄 四匹.</p></div><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And then other counters have other variations.</p><p>So it starts to seem very, very complicated,</p><p>but as a matter of fact there aren&#39;t that many variations,</p><p>and they follow a very simple pattern.</p><h3 id="kana-rows-without-sound-changes-ま-ら-わ-i-guess-な-や-if-they-exist" tabindex="-1">Kana rows without sound changes - ま, ら, わ (+ I guess な, や if they exist) <a class="header-anchor" href="#kana-rows-without-sound-changes-ま-ら-わ-i-guess-な-や-if-they-exist" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Kana rows without sound changes - ま, ら, わ (+ I guess な, や if they exist)&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="rule-1" tabindex="-1">Rule 1 <a class="header-anchor" href="#rule-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rule 1&quot;">​</a></h4><p>First of all, if the first kana of a counter can&#39;t take a ten-ten <em>=〃(another name for <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten_and_handakuten" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Dakuten</strong></a></code>)</em>,</p><p>then there aren&#39;t going to be any variations at all.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That deals with over half the problem straight away.</p><hr><p>So, if we have the counters like <code>枚</code>, counter for flat things like coins or pieces of paper.</p><p>Can you put a ten-ten on <code>枚</code>? No, you can&#39;t.</p><p>You can&#39;t put a ten-ten on any of the ま-み-む-め-も column,</p><p>and therefore there can&#39;t be any variant on <code>枚</code>:</p><p><code>一枚, 二枚, 三枚, 四枚, 五枚</code> and so on.</p><p><code>輪</code>, the counter for flowers and wheels --</p><p>Can you put a ten-ten on <code>り</code>?
