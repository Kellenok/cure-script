It reached the bottom. It was a red ball.&quot;</p><p>As you see, each time the ball is marked by <code>it</code>,</p><p>and you might say that what&#39;s being tracked here</p><p>is the subject, because it was the ball that rolled</p><p>down the hill, it was the ball that reached the bottom,</p><p>it was the ball that was red.</p><p>But we could also say &quot;I had a ball. I dropped it.</p><p>It rolled down the hill. When it reached the bottom,</p><p>Sakura picked it up and walked away with it.&quot;</p><p>Now, you see, the first <code>it</code> is the object of my dropping it:</p><p><code>I dropped it.</code></p><p>The second and third <code>it</code>:</p><p><code>It rolled down the hill... it reached the bottom</code> --</p><p>in those two the ball is the subject.</p><p>And then <code>Sakura picked it up</code>,</p><p>and it&#39;s become the object again,</p><p>the object this time of Sakura&#39;s action.</p><p>So <code>it</code> is not tracking the subject, it&#39;s not tracking the object,</p><p>it&#39;s tracking the topic, the thing we&#39;re talking about.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That&#39;s what a topic is.</p><p>And as I said, Japanese always has a topic, even though we can&#39;t always see it.</p><p>So, if we say <code>アメリカ人です</code>, usually we would</p><p>map that out as <code>zeroがアメリカ人です</code> – <code>I am an American</code>, but to be completely thorough</p><p>we would have to map it as <code><strong>zeroは</strong>zeroがアメリカ人です</code>,</p><p>that is <code>I am the topic, I am the subject, and I&#39;m an American.</code></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We don&#39;t have to go through all that every time, but it&#39;s important to know that it exists.</p><p>When the topic and the subject are the same,<br> it&#39;s not so important, but as we know they often aren&#39;t.</p><p>And in Japanese much more than in English they very often aren&#39;t.</p><p>So, in sentences like <code>コーヒーが好きだ</code>, <code>頭が痛い</code>, <code>おなかが空いた</code>, <code>クレープが食べたい</code>,</p><p>all of these are complete logical sentences:</p><p><code>Coffee is likeable</code>; <code>Head hurts</code>; <code>Stomach is empty</code>; <code>Crepes are eat-want-inducing</code>.</p><p>In each case we have an A-car, we have a B-engine, we have a complete logical clause.</p><p>But while it&#39;s logically complete, it isn&#39;t grammatically complete without understanding</p><p>that there is also an invisible は-marked topic:</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code><strong>zeroは</strong>コーヒーが好きだ</code>; <code><strong>zeroは</strong>頭が痛い</code>;<br><code><strong>zeroは</strong>おなかが空いた</code>; <code><strong>zeroは</strong>クレープが食べたい</code>.</p><p><code><strong>In relation to me</strong>, coffee is likeable/pleasing</code>;</p><p><code><strong>In relation to me</strong>, head hurts</code>;</p><p><code><strong>In relation to me</strong>, stomach is empty</code>;</p><p><code><strong>In relation to me</strong>, crepes are eat-want-inducing</code>.</p><p>And while, as with the zero が-marked pronoun,</p><p>the default is <code>I</code> but it doesn&#39;t have to be <code>I</code>,</p><p>so the は-marked zero-pronoun the same applies.</p><p>For example, if we look at a tall person go by and we say</p><p><code>背が高い、ね?</code>, literally, <code>back is high, isn&#39;t it?</code></p><p>and that&#39;s the way we say someone is tall.</p><p>But as you see, this isn&#39;t complete without</p><p>the は-marked zero pronoun: <code>zeroは背が高い</code> – <code>In relation to that person, back is tall</code>.</p><p>And because Japanese has so many constructions that don&#39;t center on an ego,</p><p>as we talked about in one of our previous videos <em>(Lesson 9)</em>,</p><p>so many constructions in which neither the A-car nor the B-engine are in fact the person concerned, like all the examples we&#39;ve just talked about,</p><p><strong>it&#39;s very necessary in lots of cases that we understand that the は-marked topic is there.</strong></p><p>And the other thing we need to understand about topic-comment structure is that</p><p><strong>the comment is always a complete logical clause.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The topic is usually a noun (it could be something else)</p><p><strong>but the comment is always and must always be a complete logical clause.</strong></p><p>This is something the textbooks don&#39;t explain,</p><p>and it may be a good thing that they don&#39;t explain it,</p><p>because if they did, I think we know how they&#39;d go about it.<br> They&#39;d present this as some kind of strange Oriental rule that we have to memorize.</p><p>But that&#39;s not what it is: it&#39;s a logical necessity.</p><p>As we know, every sentence, every logical clause, must</p><p>have an A-car and a B-engine, a subject and a predicate,<br> and as we know from our third lesson on は,</p><p><strong>は can never mark either the A-car or the B-engine, or any other element of a logical sentence. It can only mark the non-logical topic.</strong></p><p>So that means that if we&#39;re going to have a sentence</p><p>at all, both its elements have to be outside of the topic.</p><p>We have to have a topic and we also have to have</p><p>an A-car, we also have to have a B-engine.</p><hr><p>Therefore, every topic-comment sentence</p><p>only has two elements, the topic and the comment.</p><p><strong>Both the elements of the logical clause have to be in the comment.</strong></p><p>Therefore, logically, in a topic-comment sentence the comment is always a logical clause.</p><p>In another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l_ZlQQU4ZE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>video</strong></a> I&#39;ve talked, and I&#39;m going to talk again,</p><p>about some of the implications of what is called the choice between は and が;</p><p>what it means when we mark something with は, what it means when we mark it with が.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And there are a lot of implications involved here.</p><p>I won&#39;t go into them in this video but you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l_ZlQQU4ZE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>the other one</strong></a> and I&#39;ll put a card up for that.</p><p>But the thing to remember here because we&#39;re talking about the actual structure, is that</p><p>when people talk about the choice between は and が, it&#39;s confusing and somewhat misleading because it implies that は and が are somewhat similar,<br> that they do a similar kind of job.</p><p><strong>And we know that they don&#39;t. We know that</strong></p><p><strong>they&#39;re absolutely different species of particle.</strong></p><p>And what we know from this lesson is that</p><p>what we&#39;re actually doing <strong>when we&#39;re making</strong></p><p><strong>a choice between は and が is that we&#39;re choosing</strong></p><p><strong>which of two elements which are always present to make visible, whether we make the は visible, the が visible, or neither visible.</strong></p><p>So we can say <code>アメリカ人です</code>,</p><p>we can say <code>私はアメリカ人です</code>,</p><p>and we can say <code>私がアメリカ人です</code>.</p><p>And each of those has a slightly different implication.</p><p>When we&#39;re not actually choosing between は and が,</p><p>what we&#39;re choosing to do is to emphasize,</p><p>by making it visible, the topic-nature of the subject</p><p>or the subject-nature of the topic, or neither.</p><p>And which of those we choose to emphasize has big implications for what we&#39;re saying</p><p>and what we&#39;re implying…</p>',127)]))}const v=t(d,[["render",u]]);export{k as __pageData,v as default};
