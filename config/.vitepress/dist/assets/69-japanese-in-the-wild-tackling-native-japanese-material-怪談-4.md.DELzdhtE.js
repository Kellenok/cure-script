Tackling native Japanese material. Kaidan 4 | Lesson 69</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to go back to the 怪談/かいだん,</p><p>the scary Japanese story that we started a few episodes ago,</p><p>so that we can tackle some more of the challenges</p><p>of reading real native Japanese.</p><p>I&#39;ve gathered all these episodes together in one playlist,</p><p>so you can look at the whole 怪談 in one place, and</p><p>I&#39;m putting that in a link just above my head right here.</p><p>Now, to recap the story so far, our heroine</p><p>went to a drinking party at her Senpai&#39;s apartment</p><p>and, walking home late at night, she discovered that</p><p>she&#39;d left her 携帯 (her portable telephone) in Senpai&#39;s apartment.</p><p>So, she went back, knocked on the door, and there was no answer.</p><p>She tried the handle and the door was unlocked, so she walked in.</p><p>And it was completely dark in there,</p><p>so she assumed that Senpai had gone to bed already.</p><p>She thought of putting the lights on and waking her,</p><p>but remembering that she&#39;d been pretty drunk</p><p>at the time when she left she decided not to.</p><p>She groped around in the dark to find her 携帯 and then left. And that&#39;s the story so far.</p><hr><p>So let&#39;s see what happened the next day.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>翌日</code> -- that means <code>next day</code>.</p><p>This word <code>翌</code> -- as you see, the kanji is feathers or wings and the kanji for stand.</p><p>So we could say that it was the day standing in the wings waiting to come on stage,<br> which it now has.</p><p><code>翌日</code> -- The next day --</p><p><code>彼女は先輩のアパートの前を通りかかると...</code></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we have the first logical clause here</p><p>and we have a <code>と</code> which is the if/when conditional.</p><p>So something&#39;s going to follow it, but let&#39;s just look at this first one:</p><p><code>通りかかる</code> means literally <code>pass hang</code>, but what it means, what the Japanese dictionaries say is that it means <code>ちょうどその場所に通る</code>, which means really <code>just happened to be passing that particular place</code>.</p><p>So she didn&#39;t go there for any purpose, she just happened to be passing by.</p><p><code>なぜか大勢の警官が集まっている</code> –</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>大勢</code> means a large number, a crowd -- it refers to people --</p><p><code>警官</code>, as I&#39;m sure you know, is a policeman.</p><p>So, <code>なぜか...</code> (<code>なぜか</code> -- <code>for some reason</code>)</p><p>a lot of policeman were gathered -- <code>集まっている</code>.</p><p><code>集まる</code> is <code>gather</code>; <code>集まっている</code> -- <code>exist in a state of being gathered</code>.</p><p>A lot of policemen were gathered.</p><p><code>事情を聞いて彼女は驚いた</code></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>事情</code> is <code>the situation or circumstances</code>.</p><p>In English we&#39;d probably say <code>She asked what was going on</code>.</p><p>And <code>驚いた</code> usually gets translated as <code>be surprised</code></p><p>but it can be stronger than that,</p><p>and we can see that it&#39;s stronger than that in this case.</p><p>When she asked the situation, she was startled or shocked.</p><p>And the <code>彼女は</code> here also throws emphasis onto that <code>驚いた</code>,</p><p>and we&#39;re going to talk about that in a video</p><p>in the near future, this emphasizing quality of は <em>(video unknown)</em>.</p><p>When she asked the situation,</p><p>she was startled or shocked by what she heard.</p><p><code>なんと... --- </code>What! / What&#39;s this?&quot;</p><p><code>なんとあの先輩が部屋で殺されたというのだ</code> --</p><p><code>That senpai, in that apartment, received the action of being killed.</code></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And this is the receptive, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>She received the action <code>being killed</code>.</p><p><code>というのだ</code> :</p><p><code>という</code> -- that&#39;s what she was told, that&#39;s what was said;</p><p><code>のだ</code> -- now, we&#39;ve talked about these <code>んだ / のだ</code> endings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYvIOi8Q3I8&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>in another video</strong></a>.</p><p>So this is really saying, <code>It was that senpai had, in that room, received the action of being killed.</code></p><p>That&#39;s what it was; that was what was going on.</p><p>When she asked about the situation, it was that the senpai had been killed in that room.</p><hr><p><code>部屋は荒らされており</code></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>荒らす</code> is <code>storm or violate or mess up</code>.</p><p>So, the room received the action of being messed up or violated.</p><p>And the helper receptive verb is in て-form and followed by <code>おり</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>居る / おる</code> -- as we talked about in a previous episode in this series,</p><p><code>居る / おる</code> is a literary, slightly old-fashioned way of saying <code>居る / いる</code>.</p><p>So <code>荒らされておる</code> is the same as <code>荒らされている</code>:</p><p><code>was in a state of having received being violated or messed up</code>.</p><p>And then that <code>おる</code> is put into its い-stem, <code>おり</code>,</p><p>which again, as we discussed before, is a slightly more</p><p>literary way of joining two clauses in a compound sentence.</p><p>So this joins this clause to the next clause, which gives a conjecture about the situation:</p><p><code>The room was in a state of having received being messed up or violated, and...</code></p><p><code>物取りの犯行かもしれないという</code> :</p><p><code>物取り</code> is <code>もの/物</code> (thing) + <code>取る</code> (take),</p><p>so <code>物取る</code> -- <code>take thing</code>;</p><p><code>物取り</code> -- the noun of taking things, so <code>物取り</code> here is <code>theft</code>;</p><p><code>犯行</code> is a <code>criminal act</code>, a <code>criminal going</code>, literally, but a criminal act.<br> So this was perhaps or probably a crime of theft, a burglary...</p><p><code>という</code> -- <code>was said</code>. And who said it?</p><p>Well, presumably the police.</p><hr><p>Now, the next part comes in quotation marks,</p><p>those square Japanese quotation marks,</p><p>and this is something she&#39;s thinking to herself.</p><p>And we&#39;re going to see there are a number of clauses</p><p>joined together here, and then they&#39;ll all end with -たら</p><p>before we pass on to the comment about them.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So all these clauses that culminate in the -たら ending</p><p>are if-statements, conditional if-statements.</p><p>We&#39;ve talked about the conditional -たら, haven&#39;t we? <em>(Lesson 32, but also check 30 &amp; 31)</em></p><p>So, <code>あの時</code> -- <code>at that time</code> --</p><p>「電気を付けて先輩を起こして」 --</p><p><code>if I had put on the light</code> –</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code><em><strong>きちんと</strong></em>/ちゃんと戸締りをするようにって</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>ちゃんと</code> means <code>properly or correctly</code>;</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>In the video/picture, Dolly instead gives きちんと instead of ちゃんと.<br> But in basic terms, they seem to mean the same thing - along the lines of <code>properly</code>, so it should not be a big deal. There probably is some difference, but should not be detrimental here…</p></div><p><code>戸締り</code> -- <code>戸</code> is <code>door</code>, <code>締まる</code> is <code>closing</code>,</p><p>so <code>戸締り</code> is <code>door-closing</code>.</p><p>And then <code>をする</code>: you could just say</p><p><code>戸締りをする</code> -- <code>do closing the door</code> -- but here it&#39;s saying</p><p><code>戸締りをするようにって注意をしたら</code>.</p><p><code>ように</code> in this case means <code>making (something) become like (something)</code>.</p><p>So what it&#39;s really saying is <code>made it so that the door was properly closed</code>.</p><p>And then that <code>って</code> is a shortening of <code>という</code> (we&#39;ve talked about that). <em>- Lesson 18</em></p><p>So <code>という</code> meaning in this case <code>that kind of</code>;</p><p><code>注意をして</code> -- <code>注意</code> is <code>care or caution</code> --</p><p>you often see signs in Japan <code>注意をしてください</code> – <code>take care please / act cautiously</code>.</p><p>If she had in this way acted cautiously by turning on the lights, waking Senpai,</p><p>making sure that the door was properly closed --</p><p>and then this all ends with the -たら.</p><p>If she&#39;d done this...</p><p><code>こんなことにならなかったのに</code></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <code>こんなこと</code> is <code>a state of affairs like this / this state of affairs</code> ;</p><p><code>にならなかったのに</code> :</p><p>now, as we see, this is a logical clause</p><p>and it needs a subject, it needs a が-marked A-car.</p><p>So what is it? Well, it&#39;s a zero car, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><code>(Zeroが) こんなことにならなかった</code> --</p><p><code>It would not have become a thing like this.</code></p><p>Now, what does that mean?</p><p>I think we can see a very close English analogy to this.</p><p>In English we would probably say, <code>it wouldn&#39;t have come to this.</code></p><p>What she&#39;s saying is, <code>it wouldn&#39;t have become this kind of situation.</code></p><p>So it&#39;s very much the same kind of expression strategy.</p><p>If she&#39;d done all those things: if she&#39;d made sure everything was safe and proper in the house,</p><p>even at the risk of disturbing a drunken senpai, this terrible thing wouldn&#39;t have happened.</p><p>—</p><p><code>彼女が自責の念でいっぱいになりながら.</code></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>自責</code> is <code>self-blame / self-reproach</code> --</p><p><code>責</code> here, this kanji is the same as the kanji</p><p>for <code>責める</code> -- <code>criticize or blame</code> -- and the <code>ji</code> is <code>self</code>,</p><p>so <code>自責... でいっぱいなりながら</code> --</p><p><code>-ながら</code>, as I think we know, is a helper word,</p><p>meaning doing the verb it&#39;s attached to while doing something else.</p><p>Now, what she&#39;s doing here is becoming full of</p><p><code>自責の念</code> -- <code>thoughts (or feelings) of self blame</code>.</p><p>So, while becoming full of feelings of self-blame,</p><p><code>昨日その部屋にいたことを警官に話すと</code> –</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <code>と</code> is giving us an if/when statement, but we&#39;ll just deal with this to start with.</p><p><code>昨日その部屋にいたこと</code> means</p><p><code>the fact that she was in the room yesterday</code>.</p><p>Now, we know she&#39;s talking about a person (or an animal) here because it&#39;s <code>いた</code>,</p><p>so the only thing it can be is herself, the fact that she was in the room.</p><p>Had it been <code>昨日その部屋にあったこと</code>, it might be</p><p>saying <code>the thing that took place in the room yesterday</code>.</p><p>Well, we know it can&#39;t be that because it&#39;s <code>いた</code> not <code>あった</code>.</p><p>So, we&#39;re talking about a person; we&#39;re talking about her.</p><p><code>昨日その部屋にいたことを警官に話す</code></p><p>and then <code>と</code>, which is our if/when statement.</p><p>So, when she told the police the fact that she&#39;d been in the room yesterday...</p><p><code>部屋の奥から刑事が現れて...</code></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now again, it&#39;s ending in the て-form; it&#39;s going to lead on to something else.</p><p>So it&#39;s a complex sentence, but it&#39;s not really difficult</p><p>because it&#39;s made up of clear logical clauses</p><p>building one on another into a larger whole.</p><p>So, <code>部屋の奥から刑事が現れて</code>:</p><p>from the interior of the room, from inside the room</p><p>-- <code>奥</code>, <code>the inside /the interior</code> --</p><p><code>刑事</code>, that&#39;s a police detective, <code>現れて</code> -- <code>appeared</code>.</p><p>A police detective appeared from inside the room, and...</p><p><code>彼女に見て欲しい物があると言った</code></p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <code>見て欲しい</code> means <code>want someone else to see</code></p><p>just as, as we explained in a previous lesson <em>(Lesson 49)</em>,</p><p><code>見てもらう</code> means <code>have someone else see</code>,</p><p><code>見て欲しい</code> means <code>want someone else to see</code>.</p><p>And just as with <code>もらう</code>, the person who you have</p><p>doing the seeing or want to do the seeing (or want to do anything else)</p><p>is marked with に as the target of a pull-sentence.</p><p>So, <code>もらう</code> and <code>欲しい</code>,</p><p>they are receiving pull-type sentences,</p><p>so their indirect object is the person doing the thing that</p><p>we want them to do, that we receive them doing etc.</p><p>So, it&#39;s saying <code>彼女に見て欲しい物がある</code> – <code>a want-her-to-see thing exists</code>.</p><p><code>There&#39;s something I want you to look at</code> is how we&#39;d put it in English.</p><p><code>と言った</code> -- the detective said, there&#39;s something I want you to look at.</p><p>And in quotes these are the words of the detective:</p><p><code>「部屋の中で</code> -- <code>inside the room</code> --</p><p><code>こんなメモを見つけたんですが… – </code>this kind of memo (or really, this memo) we found, <em>but</em> –</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>見つけた</code>, <code>found/discovered/saw</code> – we discovered this memo -- <code>んですが</code>.</p><p><code>んですが</code> -- once again we have this <code>んです / のです</code> ending.</p><p>So what he&#39;s saying,</p><p><code>It is that we found this memo in the room</code>.</p><p>That&#39;s what it is / this is the thing:</p><p><code>It is that we found this memo in the room, but/が...</code></p><p>-- <code>これの意味が分からなくて...</code></p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Once again we&#39;re leading into something else.</p><p>&quot;Its meaning does not do understandable, and...</p><p><code>困ってんですよ」</code> --</p><p><code>困る</code> is <code>be at a loss / not know what to do</code></p><p>so <code>because its meaning does not do understandable...</code></p><p>because we can&#39;t understand its meaning, as we say in English, <code>...we&#39;re at a loss</code>.</p><p>And again that <code>んです</code> ending:</p><p><code>It is that because we can&#39;t understand its meaning, we&#39;re at a loss.</code></p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The sentence may be a bit harder to read, but I cannot zoom-in more, else for some reason it will then permanently hide the end portion of the comment with <code>...</code> instead of the text..</p></div><p><code>彼女はそのメモを見て青ざめた</code></p><p>She looked at the memo and... <code>青ざめる</code>.</p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In English that usually gets translated as <code>turned pale</code>.</p><p>What it literally means is: <code>青</code> is of course <code>blue</code></p><p>and the <code>ざめる</code> here means to <code>fade or lose color</code>.</p><p>So she faded to blue, is what it&#39;s literally saying.</p><p>And you&#39;ve probably seen in anime and manga etc. that</p><p>this is in fact how they tend to represent this situation.</p><p>You often see people&#39;s face shaded blue, usually from</p><p>the forehead down to about the middle of the face.</p><p>so turning blue is the way they represent what in English we call <code>turning pale</code>,</p><p>and we see it when someone is shocked or sick or something like that.</p><p>So, her face turned pale.</p><p><code>そこにはこう書かれていた</code> --</p><p><code>In that place</code>, that&#39;s to say, on that piece of paper,</p><p><code>it had received being written this way / it was in a state of having received being written this way</code>.</p><p>In English we&#39;d just say <code>this is what was written</code>.</p><p>And what was written?</p><p><code>電気をつけなくてよかったな</code> :</p><p><code>It&#39;s a good thing you didn&#39;t turn the lights on.</code></p><p><img src="'+v+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what do you make of that?</p><p>Who wrote that memo?</p><p>And what did he or she mean by it?</p><p>What went on in the room that night?</p>',241),I=[S];function j(T,z,A,x,W,N){return t(),o("div",null,I)}const q=e(_,[["render",j]]);export{E as __pageData,q as default};
