Japanese made easy - unlocking the <code>code</code>. Learn Japanese from scratch</strong></a></p><h2 id="the-invisible-carriage" tabindex="-1">The Invisible Carriage <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-invisible-carriage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Invisible Carriage&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the last lesson, we learned that every Japanese sentence has the same core: the main carriage and the engine, also known as A and B, also known as the thing we are talking about and the thing we are saying about it. And I told you that we can have a lot more carriages as sentences become more complex, but they still always have the same core.</p><p>Now we are going to look at some of those extra carriages.</p><p>Previously, I stated that while every sentence has the same two core elements, you can&#39;t always see both of them. You can always see the engine, but sometimes you can&#39;t see the main carriage.</p><p>Why not?</p><p><strong>When you can&#39;t see the main carriage, it’s been replaced by the invisible carriage.</strong></p><p>So, what is the invisible carriage? In English, the closest equivalent is <code>it</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, let&#39;s begin by seeing what <code>it</code> does in English. Let&#39;s look at this example:</p><blockquote><p>The ball rolled down the hill.</p><p>When the ball got to the bottom, the ball hit a sharp stone.</p><p>The ball was punctured and all the air came out of the ball.</p></blockquote><p>Now, would anybody ever say this?</p><p>Of course they wouldn&#39;t, because once we have established what we are talking about, we replace it with <code>it</code>.</p><p>Instead we say,</p><blockquote><p>The ball rolled down the hill.</p><p>When it got to the bottom, it hit a sharp stone.</p><p>It was punctured and all the air came out of it.</p></blockquote><p><code>It</code> means nothing because it can mean absolutely anything.</p><p>If I say <code>it</code>, I may be talking about a flower or about the sky.</p><p>I may be talking about a tree, or my finger, or the Eiffel Tower or the Andromeda galaxy.</p><p><code>It</code> in itself doesn&#39;t mean anything: <strong>you know what <code>it</code> is from context.</strong></p><p>Now, let&#39;s suppose a small child tries to say this and says,</p><blockquote><p>Ball rolled down hill,</p><p>got to bottom, hit sharp stone,</p><p>got punctured, all the air came out.</p></blockquote><p>Now, is that difficult to understand?</p><p>No, it isn&#39;t difficult at all, is it?</p><p>Because in fact we don&#39;t need to use <code>it</code> every time, over and over again, to understand what’s being said.</p><p>While English grammar demands we do, but there&#39;s no actual communicative need to include <code>it</code> everytime.</p><p>Japanese doesn’t have <code>it</code>. <em>(I guess what is meant is in the substituting sense as above)</em></p><p>So, if a small child, or even an adult, comes down to the kitchen at night and someone sees her,</p><p>she might say, <code>Got really hungry. Came for something to eat.</code></p><p>Again, there&#39;s nothing confusing or difficult about this.<br> She means, <code>I got really hungry. I came down for something to eat.</code></p><p><strong>In English this isn&#39;t a proper sentence, but in Japanese it is.</strong> <strong>All those little pronouns, like <code>it</code>, <code>she</code>, <code>he</code>, <code>I</code>, <code>they</code>, in Japanese can be replaced by the invisible carriage, the zero pronoun. But the important thing to remember is that they are still there.</strong></p><p>So let&#39;s look at this at work in Japanese.</p><p>I might say, <code>ドリーだ</code>, and that means <code>I am Dolly</code>.</p><p>Initially this looks as if it only has an engine and no main carriage, but actually the main carriage is simply the invisible carriage.</p><p>The full sentence is really, <code>(<strong>zeroが</strong>)ドリーだ</code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We can say that <code>I</code> is the default value of the zero pronoun, the invisible carriage.</p><p>However, the context can define it as anything.</p><p>For example, if we hear a rustling in the woods and look over in the direction of it,</p><p>and I say, <code>ウサギだ!</code>, that means <code>(<strong>zeroが</strong>)ウサギだ!</code> <code>It is a rabbit!</code></p><p>It, that thing we just looked toward, rustling in the trees, that&#39;s a rabbit.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If I say, <code>土曜日だ</code> (土曜日/どようび means Saturday), I&#39;m saying <code>(It) is Saturday</code>.</p><p>What&#39;s <code>it</code>? Today is.</p><p>All these sentences are full, complete Japanese sentences, with a が-marked subject/</p><p>A carriage/main carriage, and an engine.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="the-を-particle" tabindex="-1">The を particle <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-を-particle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The を particle&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I&#39;m going to introduce you to one more kind of carriage and that is an を car.</p><p>This means a noun marked by the particle を, pronounced <code>o</code>.</p><p>And if you know the English grammatical term <code>object</code>, which means the thing we&#39;re doing</p><p>something to, it&#39;s a good mnemonic to remember that <code>o</code> stands for <code>object</code>.</p><p>So the を car looks like this, and as you see, it&#39;s white.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s white because it&#39;s not part of the core train.</p><p><strong>The core train always consists of just two elements, the engine and the main carriage.</strong></p><p>When we see white cars, we know that they&#39;re telling us something more about the engine or about the main carriage.</p><p>So let&#39;s take a sentence here: <code>わたしがケーキを食べる</code>.</p><p>This means <code>I eat cake</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, the core sentence here is <code>I eat</code>.</p><p>Those are the two black carriages.</p><p>The white carriage, <code>ケーキを</code>, is telling us more about the engine.</p><p>The core sentence is <code>I eat</code> and <code>ケーキを</code> is telling us what it is that I eat.</p><p>Now, the interesting thing here is that we may often see this said like this: <code>ケーキをたべる</code>.</p><p>And you already know what&#39;s going on when this happens.</p><p>This is another case where we have the invisible A car.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>We can&#39;t have a sentence without a が.</strong></p><p><strong>We can&#39;t have an action being done without a doer.</strong></p><p>If we say <code>ケーキをたべる</code>, what we&#39;re really saying is <code>(zeroが)ケーキをたべる</code>.</p><p>And the default value for <code>zero</code>, for the invisible carriage, is <code>わたし</code>.</p><p>So usually this is going to be <code>I eat cake</code>, although if you were talking about someone</p><p>else at the time, it might mean that that person eats cake.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Just in case - as can be seen from from the pictures, every particle attaches to/assigns itself to the word BEFORE it, Not after it.</p></div>',75),g=[d];function m(u,b,y,w,f,v){return a(),t("div",null,g)}const I=e(p,[["render",m]]);export{k as __pageData,I as default};
