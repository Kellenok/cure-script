It&#39;s another one of our self-move/other-move pairs.</p><p><code>落ちる</code> means to <code>fall</code> – that&#39;s self-move: a thing falls, by itself.</p><p><code>落とす</code>, which ends in -す, according to the first law of self-move/other-move verbs, so</p><p>it means <code>drop</code>: we don&#39;t drop ourselves, we drop something else.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>下へ</code> : now, -へ, as we know, is the other targeting particle.</p><p>It&#39;s very similar to に, <strong>but the difference is that -へ tends to refer more to the direction</strong></p><p><strong>something is moving than to its actual target.</strong></p><p>So in this particular case, <code>下に落とす</code> <strong>wouldn&#39;t be right</strong>.</p><p>We&#39;re not saying that we&#39;re dropping it to a particular target, like <code>テーブルの下</code></p><p>– the under of the table / under the table.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We&#39;re just dropping it downwards, dropping it in a downward direction.</p><p>We don&#39;t even know what&#39;s down there.</p><p>She did try looking and she couldn&#39;t see much.</p><p>So dropping it in the direction of down – <code>下へ落とす</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>したへ落としては悪い</code>.</p><p>Now here you see, we&#39;ve just had て-form plus も; now we have て-form plus は.</p><p>And we know that も and は are the opposite twins.</p><p><strong>While も is the additive, including particle, は is the subtractive, excluding particle.</strong></p><p><strong>So, while -ても means <code>as much as</code>, -ては means <code>as little as</code>.</strong></p><h2 id="ては" tabindex="-1">ては <a class="header-anchor" href="#ては" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ては&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <strong>we tend to use -ても in positive contexts</strong> – <code>If I do <strong>as much as</strong> this, will it be all right?</code></p><p><strong>But we use -ては in negative, forbidding contexts</strong> – <code>don&#39;t even do <strong>as little as</strong> that</code>.</p><p>So we often say, <code>-<strong>ては</strong>だめ</code> – <code><strong>do that is</strong> no good / <strong>do that is</strong> bad</code> / <em>if done (action), no good.</em></p><p>In this case, it&#39;s very similar: <code>落とし<strong>ては</strong>悪い</code> – <code><strong>even as little as</strong> dropping it would be bad</code>.</p><p>The point isn&#39;t really that dropping it is a small thing, or that eating the cake is a big thing.</p><p><strong>The point is that we can go as far as eating the cake, that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t even think</strong></p><p><strong>about dropping it:</strong> <code>落としては悪い</code> – doing that is right out of the question.</p><p><strong>Very often this forbidding -ては is just contracted to -ちゃ.</strong></p><p>笑っ<strong>ちゃ</strong>だめ！- Don’t laugh! / <em>Even as little as a laugh is no good. (roughly)</em></p><p>Now this pattern continues into other uses of -ては.</p><h2 id="ては-as-a-connector-between-two-clauses" tabindex="-1">ては as a connector between two clauses <a class="header-anchor" href="#ては-as-a-connector-between-two-clauses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ては as a connector between two clauses&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For example, we can use -ては as a connector between two clauses and<br><strong>it implies that the second clause is unwanted or negative.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we can say, <code>雨が降っ<strong>ては</strong>公園に行けない</code> – <code>It&#39;s raining and we can&#39;t go to the park</code>.</p><p>Now, as we know, -て can connect two sentences and if we just said,</p><p><code>雨が降って公園に行けない</code> we&#39;re saying – <code>It&#39;s raining and we can&#39;t go to the park</code>.</p><p><strong>There&#39;s an implication that we can&#39;t go to the park because it&#39;s raining but there&#39;s</strong></p><p><strong>no suggestion of whether we&#39;re happy or unhappy with the result.</strong></p><p><code>雨が降っ<strong>ては</strong>公園にいけない</code> <strong>is indicating that the result is unpleasant or unwanted.</strong></p><p>And you can see that <strong>this does have its root in the restrictive quality of は.</strong></p><p>For example, in English we might say, <code>Just because it&#39;s raining, we can&#39;t go to the park</code></p><p>and this is exactly what は means, doesn&#39;t it?</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Bread is the direct object here (like in English).</p></div><p>If we say <code>パンを食べた</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I ate bread</code>, but if we say,<br><code>パンは食べた</code> <strong>that often implies I ate bread but I didn&#39;t eat something else.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Speaking of the bread, (I) ate. (rough translation), bread is the topic of the convo I guess?</p></div><p>Conversely, if we say, <code>パンを食べなかった</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I didn&#39;t eat bread</code>; if we say<br><code>パンは食べなかった</code>, <strong>we&#39;re often implying I didn&#39;t eat bread, but I did eat something else.</strong></p><p><code>雨が降っ<strong>ては</strong>公園に行けない</code> originally could imply something like</p><p><code><strong>Just because</strong> it&#39;s raining, we can&#39;t go to the park</code>,</p><p>but now <strong>(with ては)</strong> its implication is more</p><p><code><strong>Unfortunately, because</strong> it&#39;s raining, we can&#39;t go to the park</code>.</p><p><code><em>(zeroが)</em> 妹とけんかし<strong>ては</strong>母にしかられた</code></p><p>– <code><strong>Because</strong> (I) quarrelled with my sister, I got scolded...</code></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And again, <strong>the は in there indicates that this is a negative result.</strong></p><p><strong>So it links two complete clauses with the indication that</strong></p><p><strong>the second one follows as an unfortunate result from the first one.</strong></p><p>So this is a continuation of the negative implication of -ては.</p><h2 id="ても-でも-as-a-connector" tabindex="-1">ても / でも as a connector <a class="header-anchor" href="#ても-でも-as-a-connector" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ても / でも as a connector&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>-ても, on the other hand, when it links two sentences,</strong></p><p><strong>doesn&#39;t indicate a negative result or a positive result.</strong></p><p><strong>It indicates an unexpected or contrasting result to the first.</strong></p><p>So if we said, <code>雨が降っ<strong>ても</strong>公園に行く</code>, we&#39;re saying</p><p><code><strong>Even though</strong>*/As much as* it is raining, we&#39;re going to the park</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And you can see that this is essentially the same function as <code>でも</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>which gets translated as <code>but</code>, quite correctly.</strong></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><code>でも</code> folds up whatever went before it into that <code>で</code>, which is the て-form of <code>だ</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>So we&#39;re saying <code>that all happened</code> and the も then adds to it the <code>but</code> element,</strong></p><p><strong>the <code>even though</code>, <code>as much as</code> element.</strong></p><p>So we could also say, <code>雨が降る<strong>でも</strong>公園に行く</code>,</p><p>which means almost exactly the same as <code>雨が降っ<strong>ても</strong>公園に行く</code>.</p><p>The difference structurally is that in <code>雨が降っても</code>, the -ても only attaches to <code>降る</code>,</p><p>whereas in <code>雨が降るでも</code> the で <strong>is wrapping up the whole of the last sentence.</strong></p><p>In practice that gives us pretty much the same meaning.</p><p>So let&#39;s just go back to that sentence in Alice and see how it&#39;s structured.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s a little more complex than it looks at first, but it&#39;s very easy to understand.</p><p>And if we can understand it it gives us the key to analyzing much more complex sentences</p><p>which could give us trouble in the future.</p><p><strong>The core of the sentence is at the beginning and the end.<br> The whole sentence is just telling us what Alice thought.</strong></p><p>So the core is <code><strong>アリスは(zeroが)思った</strong></code>.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The inside of the sentence consists of two topic-comment structures.</p><p>The first topic is <code>even though it&#39;s an empty bottle</code> <strong>(topic)</strong> - (zeroが)空っぽのびんでも</p><p>and the comment on that is itself another <strong>topic-comment</strong> structure:</p><p><code><strong>as for</strong> dropping it, that would be bad</code> - 下へ落として<strong>は</strong>わるい</p><hr><p><strong>And then the whole of this double topic-comment structure is bundled up into that -と, which really means we can treat the whole thing as a kind of quasi-noun – just bundle up</strong></p><p><strong>into that -と and attribute it to Alice as her thought.</strong> <em>(思った)</em></p><p>Now, of course, as we&#39;re actually reading or looking at Japanese we don&#39;t think of</p><p><code>as for</code> or <code>speaking of</code> every time we see a topic-comment statement, because <code>as for</code></p><p>in English is much weightier, much more cumbersome than the simple は and も in Japanese.</p><p>So what do we do?</p><p><strong>Once again, as always, we don&#39;t translate it into English except when we absolutely need to, to explain it or understand it.<br> We take the Japanese as it is in itself, and that&#39;s how we learn Japanese as opposed to just learning about Japanese.</strong></p>',142),y=[f];function b(k,_,v,I,x,S){return o(),t("div",null,y)}const A=e(w,[["render",b]]);export{q as __pageData,A as default};
