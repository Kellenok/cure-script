Why do we say みんなで行く? and 世界で一番? | Lesson 55</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to drill a bit deeper into some areas of Japanese structure.</p><p>I&#39;m going to look at some aspects of the で particle that we haven&#39;t looked at so far</p><p>and, in order to do that, we&#39;re going to have to look at some new structural concepts</p><p>that we haven&#39;t considered up to this point.</p><p>We haven&#39;t considered them partly because you can get quite a long way</p><p>in elementary Japanese without knowing them,</p><p>but as we get into more complex areas it&#39;s a good idea to have these tools in our tool box.</p><p>So, let&#39;s get started.</p><p>As I&#39;ve said before, almost all Japanese words divide into three kinds,</p><p>that is, nouns, verbs and adjectives.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>There are a few words that are outside these three but not a great number.</p><p>Most of the things that aren&#39;t verbs and adjectives in fact turn out to be nouns.</p><h2 id="体言-用言" tabindex="-1">体言 &amp; 用言 <a class="header-anchor" href="#体言-用言" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;体言 &amp; 用言&quot;">​</a></h2><p>However, there&#39;s another way of dividing Japanese words which is used in Japanese grammar and that is into <code>体言</code> and <code>用言</code>, which literally means <code>body words</code> and <code>use words</code>, but the terms I&#39;m going to employ is <code>static words</code> or <code>static elements</code></p><p>and <code>active words</code> or <code>active elements</code>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, static or body words essentially boil down to nouns,</p><p>so in a way this underlines the noun-centered structure of Japanese,</p><p>because we divide them into nouns and the rest, the other two.</p><p>And it&#39;s very easy to see how this works.</p><p>By <code>active words</code> what we mean is those words that can transform, that can modify.</p><p>And that applies to both adjectives and verbs.</p><p>And in fact they transform in very much the same way.</p><p>In both cases the thing that transforms is always the last kana of the word.</p><p>And we know that both verbs and adjectives must always end in a kana.</p><p>They can&#39;t be all kanji, otherwise they&#39;d be nouns.</p><p>All verbs end in an う-row kana; all adjectives end in the kana い.</p><p>And that is the part, and the only part, that changes.</p><p>With godan verbs, the う-row kana changes to its equivalent in one of the other rows.</p><p>So, -す can become -さ, -し, -せ or -そ.</p><p>And ichidan verbs simply drop the -る.</p><p>Verbs can also modify into the て-form, and again this is essentially a question of either</p><p>changing or dropping the final kana and adding -て or で.</p><p>And the same of course with た-form.</p><p>Adjectives can change the -い to -く, -か or -け,</p><p>so we can have <code>美味しく</code>, <code>美味しかった</code> or <code>美味しければ</code>.</p><p>Or we can drop the -い altogether and add something else, as for example in <code>美味しそう</code>.</p><hr><p>Nouns, on the other hand, can&#39;t modify at all.</p><p>You can&#39;t do anything with the last kana of a noun or any other part of a noun</p><p>in terms of grammatical modification.</p><p>But you can add logical particles to a noun</p><p>and you can also add the copula <code>だ</code> or <code>です</code> to a noun.</p><p>So, we have two sets of words:</p><p>the <code>用言</code>, the active words which you can modify by changing the final kana and adding something but you can&#39;t add logical particles or the copula to these,</p><hr><p>and nouns and also pronouns and other noun-like entities, <code>体言</code> or static words,</p><p>which you can&#39;t modify but you can add logical particles or the copula.</p><p>And it&#39;s important to understand that when we add the logical particle or the copula</p><p>to a noun we regard those two things joined together as a unit.</p><hr><p>So for example when we add the soft copula <code>な</code> to an adjectival noun like <code>綺麗/きれい</code></p><p>we have <code>綺麗な</code>, and <code>綺麗な</code> is regarded as a unit in itself.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And actually that unit <em>could</em> be called a <code>な-adjective</code>, because <code>綺麗</code> plus <code>な</code> or <code>だ</code> becomes an adjectival unit.</p><p>So although I very much object to the term <code>な-adjective</code> in the way it&#39;s used by Western textbooks, which is to say they will tell you that <code>綺麗</code> is a <code>な-adjective</code>, and it&#39;s not</p><p>-- it&#39;s a noun, it&#39;s not any kind of an adjective --</p><p>we could say that <code>綺麗な</code> or <code>綺麗だ</code> is a な-adjective.</p><p>I would not recommend it, simply because the term is so abused</p><p>in Western so-called Japanese grammar that it&#39;s best left alone.</p><p>It has a name in Japanese but since it would take rather a while to explain it,</p><p>I won&#39;t go into that here. But it&#39;s not anything like <code>な-adjective</code>.</p><hr><p>Now, the other thing to understand is that when we attach the copula to a noun,</p><p>that combination is in fact a <code>用言</code> or active unit.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And that&#39;s obvious, because once you&#39;ve attached the copula to it,</p><p>we can in fact modify it.</p><p>The copula has a て-form, which is <code>で</code>, so <code>綺麗な</code> can become <code>綺麗で</code> in order to conjoin it to something else.</p><p>We can also modify <code>綺麗だ</code> into, say, <code>綺麗だった</code>.</p><p>So, once we attach the copula to a noun, we have a <code>用言</code>, an active unit,</p><p>and as I&#39;m sure you have already worked out by now,</p><p>this means that the three engines, the three possible ways of ending a sentence,</p><p>are all <code>用言</code>, or active units. That&#39;s to say, verb, adjective and noun-plus-copula.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>These are the three possible engines of a sentence</p><p>and they are also the three possible <code>用言</code>.</p><p>We tend to call them <code>用言</code> when they&#39;re modifying something else,</p><p>when they&#39;re inside a sentence.</p><p>So, armed with this information, we can now take a deeper look at the particle で.</p><h2 id="a-deeper-look-into-the-particle-で" tabindex="-1">A deeper look into the particle で <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-deeper-look-into-the-particle-で" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A deeper look into the particle で&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When I introduced it in the video on logical particles <em>(Lesson 8b)</em>,</p><p>I said that it, like the other logical particles other than が (which, of course, is in every sentence) and の (which is a logical particle, but it doesn&#39;t tell us what its noun is doing in relation to the action of the sentence; it tells us about the noun in relation to another noun)</p><p>but the other particles, including で, I said,</p><p>were only active in A-does-B sentences, that&#39;s verb-sentences.</p><p>Now, that is something of an oversimplification.</p><p>There is another way in which they can act.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t become too much of a problem not knowing that at the beginning,</p><p>but as we progress we need to understand this.</p><p>And in order to understand it we need to know what we&#39;ve just learned.</p><p>We need to know about <code>体言</code> and <code>用言</code>, static and active elements.</p><p>Because the <strong>truth is not</strong> that で is absolutely restricted to verb-sentences,</p><p>A-does-B sentences, although most of the time it is.</p><p>What it&#39;s restricted to is clauses that modify <code>用言</code>.</p><p>And the <code>用言</code>, as we know, can be a verb, but it can also be an adjective</p><p>or even an adjectival noun-plus-copula.</p><p>And there are some cases where this happens.</p><p>So what is で actually doing?</p><p>Well, as we know, there are three positional logical particles,</p><p>and they are the targeting particle に (which tells us where something goes to or where it is, where it stays once it&#39;s got there), there is へ, which is the directional particle, and there is で.</p><p>And what で really does is tells us the boundary or limit within which something happens.</p><p>Usually that&#39;s a physical boundary, a physical area, though it doesn&#39;t always have to be.</p><p>So, に tells where a noun (person, animal, thing) is headed to or where it&#39;s located;</p><p>へ tells us direction in which it&#39;s going;</p><p>で tells us the boundary within which an action or a state of being takes place.</p><p>It&#39;s usually an action, so that&#39;s how we introduce it, but it can be a state of being.</p><p>In other words, <strong>it can be an adjectival.</strong></p><p>So for example let&#39;s take the phrase <code>世界で一番美味しいラーメン</code>.</p><p>Now, people will ask, <code>Why で? Why are we using で in this case?</code></p><p>And the answer is that <code>世界で</code> -- and remember that</p><p>we always treat a logical particle plus the noun it&#39;s attached to as a unit --</p><p><code>世界で</code> is defining the limit within which something is happening,</p><p>but in this case it&#39;s defining the limit within which a state of being applies.</p><p>So we&#39;re talking about <code>the most delicious ramen in the world</code>.</p><p><code>The world/<strong>世界</strong></code> is the limit we&#39;re applying.</p><p>And in this case, of course, with <code>the world</code> we&#39;re trying to give as big a limit as possible.</p><p>But we might say, <code>この町で一番美味しいラーメン</code></p><p>and then we&#39;re saying <code>the most delicious ramen in this town</code>.</p><p>So we&#39;ve drawn a boundary around it.</p><p>We&#39;re not saying it&#39;s the most delicious ramen possible, but we are saying within certain limits, within the limits of this town, it&#39;s the most delicious ramen.</p><p>So <strong>that&#39;s what で is doing</strong>.</p><p>Just as with an action it tells us where the action takes place, the locality, the boundary within which it takes place, with the other kind of <code>用言</code>, an adjectival,</p><p>it&#39;s telling us the boundary within which that adjectival quality prevails.</p><hr><p>Now, we can also say <code>世界の一番美味しいラーメン</code>.</p><p>That&#39;s less commonly said, but it could be said.</p><p>And what that means is <code>the most delicious ramen of the world</code>,</p><p>but the point to understand here is that で is drawing the boundaries of the <code>用言</code>, the active element, the verb or in this case the adjective; <strong>の is doing something different.</strong></p><p>We know what の does: it links one noun to another.</p><p>So it&#39;s not modifying the quality of <code>美味しい</code>, as で is.</p><p>It&#39;s modifying <code>ラーメン</code>.</p><hr><p>And because of this <strong>we can also say</strong> <code>このラーメンは世界で一番美味しい</code></p><p>-- we&#39;re saying <code>This ramen is the most delicious in the world.</code></p><p>But we <strong>can&#39;t</strong> say <code>このラーメンは世界の一番美味しい</code></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Why can&#39;t we?</p><p>Because, as we know from the lesson on word order <em>(Lesson 46)</em>,</p><p>in Japanese words only modify words that come after them.</p><p>They can&#39;t modify words that come before them.</p><p>And because の can&#39;t modify <code>美味しい</code>, it can only modify <code>ラーメン</code>, which is another noun, and because <code>ラーメン</code> is on the wrong side of it, we can&#39;t actually use that.</p><p>So we have to say <code>このラーメンは世界で一番美味しい</code>,</p><p>because で sets the boundary within which <code>美味しい</code> prevails.</p><hr><p>Now, since we know that a noun-plus-copula also functions as a <code>用言</code>, an active element,</p><p>we can also say <code>世界で一番有名なアンドロイド</code>.</p><p>And in this case, <code>世界で</code> is modifying <code>有名な</code>.</p><p>It couldn&#39;t modify <code>有名</code> on its own, because <code>有名</code> is a noun, but it can modify <code>有名な</code>.</p><p>So it&#39;s telling us the boundaries within which this fame operates.</p><p><code>She&#39;s the most famous android in the world</code>.</p><p>She may not be the most famous android in the Solar System,</p><p>but she is the most famous android in the world.</p><p>Now the same happens when we say something like <code>みんなで踊る</code> -- <code>we all dance</code>.</p><p>Why do we say <code>みんなで</code>?</p><p>Well, if we say <code>二人で踊る</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>two of us dance</code>.</p><p>If we say <code>一人で踊る</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>dance alone</code>.</p><p>The quantitative sentence plus で is describing the limits of the people who do it.</p><p>So, as I said before, the boundary or area or demarcation that で draws for us</p><p>is usually a physical one, a place.</p><p>If we say <code>部屋で踊る</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I dance in the room.</code></p><p><strong>But</strong> if we say <code>一人で踊る</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I dance alone.</code></p><p>In both cases we&#39;re drawing a boundary to say what are the limits.</p><p>The physical limits are the room,</p><p>and the numerical or quantitative limits are <code>一人</code>, <code>二人</code>, <code>みんな</code> etc.</p>',168),l=[r];function u(w,m,y,g,f,b){return o(),t("div",null,l)}const k=e(h,[["render",u]]);export{_ as __pageData,k as default};
