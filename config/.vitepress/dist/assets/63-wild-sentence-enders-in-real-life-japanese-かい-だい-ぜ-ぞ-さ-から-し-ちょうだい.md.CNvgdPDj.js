Japanese かい、だい,、ぜ、ぞ、さ、から、し、ちょうだい | Lesson 63</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about some more of those things that hit us between the eyes</p><p>as soon as we leave the walled garden of theoretical Japanese</p><p>and venture into the wild woods of the real thing.</p><p>One of the things people often ask me about</p><p>are the various sentence-enders they encounter.</p><p>And I&#39;m not talking about the tame ones</p><p>like <code>ね</code>, <code>よ</code> and <code>な</code> – I&#39;ve done <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWEok4Ivfyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>a video</strong></a> about those if you&#39;re interested</p><p>and I&#39;ll pop a link for that over my head.</p><p>But today we&#39;re going to talk about some of the more colloquial and unconventional sentence-enders that you&#39;re going to run into once you get into <code>wild Japanese</code><br> in anime, manga, etc.</p><h2 id="かい" tabindex="-1">かい <a class="header-anchor" href="#かい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;かい&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, one of the ones I often get asked about is <code>かい</code>,<br> and <code>かい</code> is simply a softened and colloquial form of <code>か</code>.</p><p>As we know, <code>か</code> is regularly used in formal Japanese,</p><p>where we use the です/ます decorations at the end of sentences, to form questions.</p><p>So we say <code>何々しますか / 何々ですか</code>.</p><p>But in colloquial Japanese we don&#39;t use <code>か</code> as</p><p>a sentence-ender question-marker all that often.</p><p><strong>We do use it in other positions</strong> -- and</p><p>I&#39;ve done a video about the various ways we use <code>か</code> <em>(Lesson 39)</em></p><p>and I&#39;ll pop a link for that over my head too.</p><p>But where we don&#39;t tend to use it in informal speech, on the whole,</p><p>is at the end of sentences marking questions, the way it does in です/ます Japanese.</p><p>And that&#39;s not because it&#39;s ungrammatical, in fact it&#39;s perfectly grammatical, but in</p><p>modern Japanese it&#39;s come to sound a little bit rough,</p><p>so while you may hear it between men who are being <code>one of the boys</code> together,</p><p>you don&#39;t hear it so often in female speech or in the speech of anyone who&#39;s trying to be a bit courteous.</p><p>So what do we do?</p><p>Most of the time we simply use a rising intonation in speech</p><p>or a question mark in writing where we&#39;re depicting casual speech.</p><p>And there&#39;s nothing wrong with this.</p><p>Spanish continually makes questions by simply adding a rising intonation to the equivalent statement and there are no problems there.</p><p>There are no problems in Japanese either.</p><p>Sometimes we add <code>の</code>, which is ambiguous,</p><p>because it can mark either a question or a statement,</p><p>but again that doesn&#39;t really matter because intonation works just as well.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>However, we do have the informal, non-rough-sounding question-marker <code>かい</code>.</p><p>You might think that would be used all the time, <strong>but it isn&#39;t</strong>,<br> because it sounds very colloquial indeed and sometimes a little bit... well, folksy.</p><p>Some sources say it&#39;s primarily masculine</p><p>and that&#39;s kind of half-way true.</p><p>You don&#39;t hear many younger female speakers using it,</p><p>but you do sometimes hear older female speakers using it.</p><h2 id="だい-どうだい" tabindex="-1">だい (&amp; どうだい) <a class="header-anchor" href="#だい-どうだい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;だい (&amp; どうだい)&quot;">​</a></h2><p><code>かい</code> also has a partner, which is <code>だい</code>.</p><p><strong><code>だい</code> is really <code>だ</code> plus <code>かい</code>.</strong></p><p>So this is the form of <code>かい</code> that we use in<br> copula-ending sentences, <code>だ</code>-ending sentences.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And just about everything I&#39;ve said about <code>かい</code> also applies to <code>だい</code>,<br><strong>except</strong> that there is a particular collocation, <code>どうだい</code>, which is much more widely used.</p><p>So, if somebody&#39;s eating something and you say</p><p><code>どうだい?</code> -- <code>what&#39;s it like? / how is it?</code> --</p><p>and they might say <code>おいしい/美味しい!</code> or they might say <code>まずい/不味い</code>,</p><p>but <strong>asking it in that form is something anybody can do provided it&#39;s an informal setting.</strong></p><h2 id="ちょうだい" tabindex="-1">ちょうだい <a class="header-anchor" href="#ちょうだい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ちょうだい&quot;">​</a></h2><p>People also come across the expression <code>ちょうだい</code>,</p><p><strong>and that&#39;s not related to <code>かい</code> or <code>だい</code> at all;</strong></p><p><strong>it&#39;s an informal equivalent to <code>ください</code>.</strong></p><p>So it&#39;s usually adding it to the て-form of a verb to ask someone to do something.</p><p>It&#39;s sometimes considered to be female speech <strong>but it is not exclusively so.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="ぜ、ぞ、さ" tabindex="-1">ぜ、ぞ、さ <a class="header-anchor" href="#ぜ、ぞ、さ" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ぜ、ぞ、さ&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Other real sentence-ender markers in casual speech are <code>ぜ</code>, <code>ぞ</code> and <code>さ</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>ぜ</code> and <code>ぞ</code> are very simple.</p><p>They&#39;re just verbal exclamation marks which</p><p>lend a little force to whatever it is you&#39;re saying.</p><p><strong>They&#39;re quite rough and really are masculine speech</strong></p><p><strong>and they&#39;re the sort of thing you&#39;ll probably see</strong></p><p><strong>more in anime and manga than you will in real life.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>さ</code> is similar but it&#39;s not nearly so rough.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s much more widely used</strong>, you&#39;ll see a lot of it, and you&#39;ll hear it in real life.</p><p>It tends to get called masculine speech, but again <strong>it&#39;s not exclusively masculine speech</strong>.</p><p>All kinds of people use it.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s important not to confuse <code>さ</code>, the emphasis-lending sentence-ender,</strong></p><p><strong>to <code>さあ</code>, which comes at the beginning of a sentence and is more of a pause-for-thought kind of expression.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, there are also sentence-enders <strong>that are not sentence-enders but effectively they are</strong>, because people do pop them after the engine at the end of a sentence.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> Here, Dolly also suggests watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au5JOtcwE7A&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>video</strong></a> on pseudo-enders, のに &amp; なのに respectively.</p><p>One of these is <code>から</code>.</p><h2 id="から-sentence-ender" tabindex="-1">から <code>sentence-ender</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#から-sentence-ender" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;から &lt;code&gt;sentence-ender&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <code>から</code>, as you know, <strong>is not technically a sentence-ender.</strong></p><p><strong>What it is is a conjunction that joins two logical clauses to make a compound sentence.</strong></p><p>So a proper use of <code>から</code> might be:</p><p><code>さくらが来ないから帰ります</code>, which means<br><code>Because Sakura isn&#39;t coming, I&#39;m going home / Sakura isn&#39;t coming, so I&#39;m leaving</code>.</p><p>However, you might simply say as you are leaving, <code>さくらが来ないから</code>,<br> and that is just leaving the other half of the sentence unsaid because it&#39;s obvious.</p><p>Now, from that, <code>から</code> can be added to a lot of sentences</p><p>to imply that something else is coming.</p><p><strong>That extra something else isn&#39;t always completely clear.</strong></p><p>In fact, the <code>から</code> may be performing the function</p><p>of either softening what it marks or hardening it.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It can soften it by making the statement feel explanatory;</p><p>it can harden it by making it sound as if it&#39;s part of</p><p>a logical argument or a natural piece of reasoning</p><p>that the hearer ought to understand and agree with.</p><p>So, for example, if you&#39;re riding your bicycle</p><p>in a place where you shouldn&#39;t be riding a bicycle</p><p>and somebody official comes up to you and says</p><p><code>自転車に乗るのは禁止ですから</code> [polite tone],</p><p>that&#39;s conciliatory, and really all they want to say is</p><p><code>It&#39;s forbidden to ride a bicycle around here</code>,</p><p>but by adding the <code>から</code> to the end of it,</p><p>they&#39;re kind of softening it, turning it into an explanation for you.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Conversely, they might say</p><p><code>自転車に乗るのは禁止ですから</code> [stern tone],</p><p>and that has a different implication.</p><p>There, the <code>禁止</code> is being rammed home all the harder for that <code>から</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, <code>から</code> can have a variety of uses, often depending on context,</p><p>on the way in which they&#39;re said,</p><p>on the demeanor of the person saying them,</p><p>and on the whole situation.</p><h2 id="し-sentence-ender" tabindex="-1">し sentence-ender <a class="header-anchor" href="#し-sentence-ender" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;し sentence-ender&quot;">​</a></h2><p><code>し</code> is another very common sentence-ending particle</p><p>which is similar to <code>から</code> and has a meaning in the same area.</p><p><code>し</code> can actually combine various conditions or statements,</p><p><strong>but its most common and regular use is to combine reasons.</strong></p><p>So, for example, we might say,</p><p><code>遅くなったしさくらが来ないし帰ります</code>,</p><p>and that means &quot;Because it&#39;s gotten late and</p><p>because Sakura isn&#39;t coming, I&#39;m going home&quot;.</p><p>And <strong>this is the most standard kind of use of <code>し</code>.</strong></p><hr><p>But then we might often use it for only one condition, implying others.</p><p>For example, if we said</p><p><code>遅くなったし帰ります</code>, we&#39;re saying</p><p><code>because it&#39;s gotten late, I&#39;m going home</code>,</p><p><strong>but we&#39;re also implying that the fact that it&#39;s gotten late isn&#39;t the only reason:</strong></p><p><code>Because it&#39;s gotten late (and for other reasons) I&#39;m going home.</code></p><p>And this, in this particular case, probably implies that it&#39;s not just because it&#39;s getting late,</p><p><strong>it&#39;s also because Sakura isn&#39;t coming, but we&#39;re leaving unstated the more personal part of it.</strong></p><p>Now conversely, we might say</p><p><code>さくらが来ないし帰ります</code></p><p>and this time we&#39;ve put in the most important part, the real reason for our leaving,</p><p>but by saying <code>し</code> rather than <code>から</code> we&#39;re also saying</p><p><code>Because Sakura isn&#39;t coming (and for other reasons) I&#39;m leaving.</code></p><p><strong>What this does is take the pressure off Sakura.</strong></p><p>Although she may be the main reason, we&#39;re diffusing it a bit by suggesting</p><p>that there are also other reasons.<br><strong>And we might do this when there are no other reasons at all,</strong></p><p><strong>just as a way of softening and diffusing the statement.</strong></p><p>Another example might be,</p><p>suppose you&#39;re riding your bicycle again</p><p>in that place where you shouldn&#39;t be riding it</p><p>and this time a friend comes up to you and says,</p><p><code>自転車に乗るのは禁止し</code>.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Yes, normally, after 禁止, there would be だ before し. But since this is casual, it is left off.</p></div><p>Now, <strong>the difference between this and the <code>から</code> statement</strong></p><p><strong>is simply that the <code>し</code> is diffusing it.</strong></p><p>It&#39;s saying &quot;Oh, because it&#39;s forbidden to ride</p><p>a bicycle here and for other reasons...&quot;</p><p><strong>Now, there aren&#39;t any <code>other reasons</code> at all, but</strong></p><p><strong>what this does is make it sound a bit more colloquial, a bit more friendly</strong>,<br> and it vagues up a bit that <code>から</code> which can sound too much like an order.</p><p>It&#39;s just saying <code>Oh, for that and other reasons</code>.</p><p>And this <code>vaguing up</code> tactic</p><p>often takes place in languages.</p><p>In English it&#39;s often done by adding words like</p><p><code>like</code> or <code>kinda</code> to what you&#39;re saying.</p><p>Now, the ways in which these sentence-enders work</p><p>can&#39;t be learned from structure alone or from abstract instruction alone.</p><p><strong>We need to immerse in Japanese to get the feel of</strong></p><p><strong>what people mean when they say these things.</strong></p><p>But conversely, understanding the structure,</p><p>understanding how they really fit together,</p><p>gives us a substantial boost in being able to make sense of our immersion.</p><p>It&#39;s rather like a rope and climbing a mountain.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Indeed, ‘tis modified a bit …somewhat…*cough*…bizarrely… ╮(︶▽︶)╭<br> *If you have a rope, that will help you climb the mountain,</p></div><p>but if you just stand staring and learning all about the rope</p><p>you&#39;ll never get to the top of the mountain.</p><p>Conversely, if you try to climb the mountain without the rope, you may not get very far…</p>',173)]))}const I=t(m,[["render",y]]);export{q as __pageData,I as default};
