What schools never teach. The core Japanese sentence -organic Japanese</strong></a></p><p>The most basic thing about Japanese is the Japanese core sentence. Every Japanese sentence fundamentally has the same core. What does it look like? It looks like this.</p><p>We&#39;re going to picture it as a train. Every Japanese sentence has these two elements:<br><strong>the main carriage, A</strong> and <strong>the engine, B</strong>.</p><p><strong>The engine is what makes the sentence move, what makes it work.</strong></p><p><strong>The carriage has to be there because without the carriage there&#39;s nothing for the engine to move</strong>. Those two things are the core of every Japanese sentence.</p><p>We can say more about A; we can say more about B; we can combine logical sentences together to make complex sentences.<br><strong>But every Japanese sentence conforms to this basic type.</strong></p><p>So, what are A and B? Let&#39;s begin by reminding ourselves that in any language there are only two kinds of sentences: <code>A is B</code> sentences and <code>A does B</code> sentences.</p><p>An example of an <code>A does B</code> sentence is <code>Sakura walks</code>.</p><p>An example of an <code>A is B</code> sentence is <code>Sakura is Japanese</code>.</p><p>And we can put these into the past tense; we can put them in the negative; we can turn them into questions; we can say more about A; we can say more about B.<br> But, <strong>ultimately, every sentence boils down to one of these:<br> an <code>A is B</code> or an <code>A does B</code> sentence.</strong></p><p>So let&#39;s look at how we do this in Japanese.</p><h2 id="verb-sentences" tabindex="-1">Verb sentences <a class="header-anchor" href="#verb-sentences" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Verb sentences&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In Japanese, if we want to say <code>Sakura walks</code> (A does B: Sakura walks), then A is Sakura, the main carriage, and B is walks, the thing she does, the engine of the sentence.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Walk in Japanese is <code>あるく</code>. We need one more thing to make the core Japanese sentence, and <strong>that is the linchpin of every sentence, が</strong> (ga).</p><p><strong>が is the center of Japanese grammar.</strong> <strong>Every Japanese sentence revolves around が.</strong><br><strong>In some sentences we&#39;re not going to be able to see the が, but it&#39;s always there, and it&#39;s always doing the same job.</strong> <strong>It links together A and B and turns them into a sentence.</strong><br> So, our core <code>A does B</code> sentence is <code><strong>さくらが</strong>あるく</code> = <code><strong>Sakura</strong> walks</code>.</p><h2 id="copula-sentences" tabindex="-1">Copula sentences <a class="header-anchor" href="#copula-sentences" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Copula sentences&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now let&#39;s take an A is B sentence: <code>Sakura is Japanese</code>, or, as we say, <code>Sakura is a Japanese person</code>. So, A again is Sakura, B is にほんじん/日本人, which means Japanese person, and <strong>once again we need が to link them together.</strong></p><p><strong>So we&#39;re going to picture the A car, the main carriage, with a が on it, because the main</strong></p><p><strong>carriage, the subject of the sentence, always carries a が, to link it to the engine.</strong></p><p>So, さくらが日本人 – and we need one more thing.</p><p>There&#39;s one other thing that I want you to make friends with, and that&#39;s だ (da).</p><p><code>さくらが日本人だ</code> = <code>Sakura is a Japanese person</code>.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, you may have met this だ in its fancy form, です, but there are very good reasons</p><p>for learning the plain, simple form first.</p><p>So we&#39;re going to learn だ.</p><p>Now if you look at だ, it&#39;s like an equals sign boxed off to the left.</p><p>And this is a perfect mnemonic for what it does, because <strong>だ tells us that A is B.</strong></p><p>Why is it boxed off to the left?</p><p>Because it only works one way.</p><p>Think about this logically: さくらが日本人だ means <code>Sakura = Japanese person.</code></p><p>But it doesn&#39;t work the other way: Japanese people are Sakura – they&#39;re not all Sakura.</p><p>Sakura is a Japanese person, but a Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura.</p><h2 id="adjective-sentences" tabindex="-1">Adjective sentences <a class="header-anchor" href="#adjective-sentences" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Adjective sentences&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So now we have an <code>A is B</code> sentence and an <code>A does B</code> sentence.</p><p>There is one more form of the Japanese core sentence, for it has three forms.</p><p>The third form is when we have a describing word, an adjective.</p><p><strong>In Japanese, describing words end with い</strong> (i), just as they often do in English: happy, sunny, cloudy, silly.</p><p>In Japanese it&#39;s just the same:<br> happy – うれしい/嬉しい; sad – かなしい/悲しい; blue – あおい/青い.</p><p>Now, we don&#39;t have to learn all these, but we do need to know about Japanese adjectives</p><p>ending in い because they make the third kind of sentence.</p><p>So let&#39;s take an easy one: ペン (that&#39;s a nice easy word because it means pen) –</p><p><code>ペンが赤い/あかい</code> = <code>pen is red</code>.</p><p>Now, you notice that we don&#39;t have a だ on this sentence.</p><p>Why is that?</p><p><strong>Because the い-adjective あかい/赤い (red) – it doesn&#39;t mean red, it means is-red.</strong></p><p><strong>The だ function, the equals function, is built into those い-adjectives.</strong><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So those are the three forms of Japanese sentence.</p><p><strong>They all start with the subject of the sentence, they&#39;re all connected with が</strong>, and<br> they can end in three ways: with a verb, which will end in う, with the copula だ, or with an い</p><p>because the last word is an adjective. And now you know the basics of Japanese.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>',53),h=[p];function d(l,g,u,m,w,y){return n(),t("div",null,h)}const k=e(c,[["render",d]]);export{f as __pageData,k as default};
