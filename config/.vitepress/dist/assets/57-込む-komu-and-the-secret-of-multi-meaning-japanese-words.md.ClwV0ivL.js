Japanese words | Lesson 57</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about one word in particular that has a lot of different meanings in different contexts and can be attached to other words.</p><p>But, more than that, we&#39;re going to talk about how this kind of word works and how we can understand them.</p><p>We often see in dictionaries words that have a whole range of different and apparently unconnected meanings.</p><p>I&#39;m not talking about homophones here, where the kanji are different.</p><p>They may not be related, though they sometimes are.</p><p>But I&#39;m talking about words that actually are the same word</p><p>but have a range of different meanings.</p><p>And in these cases the important thing to understand</p><p>is that normally there&#39;s going to be a base, concrete meaning</p><p>and then from that a number of metaphorical meanings.</p><p>And this isn&#39;t just a side issue with human language.</p><p>Human language, whenever it discusses abstraction,</p><p>uses words that are based in concrete, physical metaphors.</p><p>And we may sometimes forget the concrete, physical metaphors,</p><p>but they&#39;re always there.</p><p>Even when we talk about time, we have to talk about it in terms of space.</p><p>We talk about time <code>going forward</code> or <code>going backward</code>.</p><p>We talk about a time <code>line</code> -- a line is an entity that exists in space.</p><p>We can&#39;t actually discuss time without discussing it in terms of space.</p><p>And this continues with all other abstractions in human languages.</p><p>The word <code>focus</code> originally means a <code>hearth</code>.</p><p>People used to sit around the hearth fire</p><p>and that would be at the center, the focus of their activity.</p><p>And from that physical metaphor come all the extended</p><p>and abstract meanings of the word <code>focus</code>.</p><p>The word <code>stimulus</code> originally meant an <code>ox-goad</code>,</p><p>a pointed stick that you would drive oxen along with.</p><p>And from that come all the abstract meanings of <code>stimulus</code>.</p><p><code>Politics</code> comes from a word that simply means <code>city</code>.</p><p><code>Economics</code> comes from a word that simply means <code>house</code>.</p><p>Now, we don&#39;t need to know the physical metaphors on which words like this are based,</p><p>but when we come across words in Japanese that seem to have different and contradictory meanings, we do need to understand the basic metaphor</p><p>in order to grasp the other meanings</p><p>without learning them as a long laundry-list of apparently random things.</p><p>So, if we see the word <code>切る</code> in a dictionary -- which means <code>cut</code> --</p><p>we see lots and lots of meanings for it like <code>ending a conversation</code>,</p><p><code>severing a relationship</code>, <code>crossing a field</code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And all of these just come from the basic meaning of <code>cut</code>.</p><p>Even in English we talk about <code>cutting across a field</code>.</p><p>Now, that&#39;s easy enough, so long as we understand the principle,</p><p>with a word like <code>cut</code>, where we have a very definite,</p><p>clear-cut (if I may say so) equivalent in English.</p><p>But when we come to words which don&#39;t have an exact English equivalent,</p><p>it can get a bit harder unless we understand what they mean.</p><p>And one of those words, which we&#39;re going to see</p><p>everywhere in Japanese, is the word <code>込む</code>.</p><h2 id="込む" tabindex="-1">込む <a class="header-anchor" href="#込む" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;込む&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <code>込む</code> does not have an exact meaning in English,</p><p>but we can see what it does mean by looking at the kanji.</p><p>The kanji is essentially the kanji of <code>入る / 入る / 入れる</code><br> -- <code>go in</code> or <code>put in</code> -- and that&#39;s on a <code>road</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s a road that some people call <code>the water slide</code>.</p><p>I always see it as a <code>fast road</code></p><p>and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going on here.</p><p>It&#39;s &quot;putting in on a water slide / putting in on roller skates /</p><p>cramming in in large quantities / putting in rapidly / putting in vigorously&quot;.</p><p>That&#39;s what <code>込む</code> means.</p><p>Now, we may encounter it first of all in very simple, concrete meanings</p><p>such as <code>込んでいる</code>, the state of being <code>込む</code>,</p><p>and that means <code>crowded</code>:</p><p>a lot of people crammed into the same space, crowded.</p><p>Now, it can have more abstract meanings like <code>complicated</code>,</p><p>which is essentially the same: a lot of ideas, a lot of concepts,</p><p>crammed into the same mental space, that&#39;s a complication.</p><h3 id="飛び込む" tabindex="-1">飛び込む <a class="header-anchor" href="#飛び込む" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;飛び込む&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And then it becomes attached as a helper verb to the i-stem of other verbs.</p><p>So we have <code>飛び込む</code>, which means <code>jump in</code>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It can mean literally jump into the water or something,</p><p>but it can also mean jumping vigorously into a conversation, a situation,</p><p>or any of the other metaphorical uses of <code>jumping in</code>.</p><h3 id="黙り込む" tabindex="-1">黙り込む <a class="header-anchor" href="#黙り込む" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;黙り込む&quot;">​</a></h3><p>It can become more abstract, with concepts like <code>黙り込む</code>.</p><p><code>黙る</code> means to <code>be silent</code>.</p><p><code>黙り込む</code> means to <code>be quiet</code> about something / <code>clam up</code> about something,</p><p>in other words, be quiet and keep everything 込む-ed up inside oneself,</p><p>not letting anything out.</p><h3 id="読み込む" tabindex="-1">読み込む <a class="header-anchor" href="#読み込む" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;読み込む&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, the word <code>読み込む</code> is one that you&#39;ll see often</p><p>if you have your computer or your tablet or whatever in Japanese.</p><p>(And if you haven&#39;t, why not?)</p><p>You&#39;ll often see the word come up <code>読み込み中</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>-中</code> means <code>in process of</code>.</p><p>It means literally <code>in the middle of</code> -- another metaphor,</p><p>because literally it means <code>middle</code> or <code>center</code> or <code>inside</code>.</p><p>But in this case, when it&#39;s attached to a verb like this,</p><p><code>中</code> means <code>in the process of</code>.</p><p>As we might say in English, <code>in the middle of doing something</code>.</p><p><code>読み込み中</code> is <code>being in the process of 読み込む-ing</code>,</p><p>and <code>読み込む</code> here means <code>loading</code>.</p><p>It means <code>reading and cramming in</code>:</p><p>reading data and putting it into memory.</p><p>But the word has various other meanings, and while they are different,</p><p>they&#39;re all based on the same fundamental metaphor.</p><p>So <code>読み込む</code> can mean reading something several times, reading it thoroughly.</p><p><code>込む</code> can mean doing something repeatedly,</p><p>because again it&#39;s cramming in iterations of doing it,</p><p>cramming in reps, you might say.</p><p>But it can mean reading thoroughly, it can mean reading repeatedly,</p><p>in any case it means cramming the subject matter into your mind.</p><p>And again, <code>読み込む</code> can mean reading something into something:</p><p>somebody says something or you see a text,</p><p>and you put in extra meaning which you believe to be there.</p><p>And very often it is. Texts can have implications.</p><p>Reading something into something again can be <code>読み込む</code>.</p><p>And again it&#39;s a very obvious and natural use of the metaphor.</p><p>And once again, <code>読み込む</code> can mean</p><p>reading poetry or something with feeling, with emotion.</p><p>You&#39;re not just reading it; you&#39;re putting something into it,</p><p>you&#39;re putting in the emotion, you&#39;re cramming it with something,</p><p>with emotion, with feeling, with expression.</p><p>So, all these meanings of <code>読み込む</code> are different</p><p>and yet all of them essentially conform to the same metaphor:</p><p>read and cram something in.</p><h3 id="思い込む" tabindex="-1">思い込む <a class="header-anchor" href="#思い込む" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;思い込む&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, another common compounded verb with <code>込む</code> is <code>思い込む</code>.</p><p>Now, the most common use of that, I would say,</p><p>is to <code>be under the impression / to be convinced of</code> something,</p><p>usually something that turns out not to be true, but that doesn&#39;t have to be the case.</p><p>So, <code>思い</code> is <code>thought</code> and <code>込む</code> is <code>cramming in</code>,</p><p>so you have this thought crammed in, or this set of thoughts crammed into your mind.</p><p>Whether they&#39;re true or not, they&#39;re in there, they&#39;re lodged in your mind.</p><p>And, interestingly, in older English, people sometimes used to talk about <code>cramming</code> someone,</p><p>meaning filling them up with wrong ideas, giving them false impressions,</p><p>cramming into their mind a particular set of ideas which would generally not be correct,</p><p>at least in the opinion of the speaker.</p><p>So <code>思い込む</code> in that sense usually means</p><p>having a strong impression, a strong belief, a strong notion</p><p>that something is the case that probably in fact isn&#39;t.</p><p>But <code>思い込む</code> can mean other things as well.</p><p>It can mean <code>being in love</code> and it can mean <code>having one&#39;s heart set</code> on something.</p><p>And in order to understand that, we need to know</p><p>a little more about the word <code>思い</code>, which,</p><p>as I pointed out toward the end of another video,</p><p>doesn&#39;t necessarily just mean <code>thought</code> or <code>feeling</code>.</p><p>It can also mean <code>love</code> or <code>desire</code>.</p><p>So, for example, the word <code>片思い</code> means <code>one-sided love</code>.</p><p><code>片</code> generally means <code>side</code> or <code>direction</code></p><p>and <code>片思い</code> is <code>one-sided or one-directional love / unrequited love</code>.</p><p>So <code>思い</code> there is being used in the sense of <code>love / affection / desire</code>.</p><p>So <code>思い込む</code> can mean <code>being in love</code>.</p><p>It can also mean <code>having one&#39;s heart set on something</code>,</p><p>and that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean loving a person.</p><p>It could mean having one&#39;s heart set on going on a picnic, or anything.</p><p>The point here is that <code>思い</code> in the sense of desire and love is crammed into one.<br> It&#39;s not just a passing whim, it&#39;s something that one&#39;s whole heart is set on,<br> something <code>crammed in</code>.</p><hr><p>We&#39;ll come across a few other meanings of <code>込む</code> too, especially when it&#39;s used,<br> as it very often is, as a helper verb put onto the い-stem of another verb.</p><p>But once we understand this point, that it&#39;s to do with cramming,</p><p>that it&#39;s to do with filling, that it&#39;s to do with thoroughness,</p><p>completeness, or with locking away,</p><p>then we can understand how these other words</p><p>are going to work when we hear them.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>there is this one interesting* <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31xnxSFUCiw&amp;lc=Ugx7rl5ZlBI3QADLH3R4AaABAg&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>comment</strong></a>*.
