Lesson 82</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about three words that you&#39;ll encounter often in your immersion.</p><p><strong>They have quite a wide meaning spectrum, and that means that</strong></p><p><strong>dictionaries can&#39;t really cover the full range of what they mean,</strong></p><p>especially when, as they often are, they&#39;re used in very colloquial ways.</p><p>And I&#39;d like to thank all the people who tell me which words give them trouble in immersion.</p><p>This helps me to know what to cover and in what order to cover it.</p><p>A lot of people wanted to know about <code>なんて</code> and <code>なんか</code>.</p><p>So if you have words that are giving you trouble, please pop them in the Comments below.</p><p>It&#39;s very helpful to know what it is that&#39;s causing problems.</p><p><strong>So, the three words are <code>など</code>, <code>なんて</code> and <code>なんか</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>They have different meanings but they overlap in certain areas.</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And the simplest one is <code>など</code>, so we&#39;re going to start off with that.</p><h2 id="など" tabindex="-1">など <a class="header-anchor" href="#など" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;など&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong><code>など</code> essentially means pretty much what <code>etcetera</code> means in English,</strong></p><p><strong>but the thing to bear in mind in formal language</strong> is that</p><p><strong>it has higher status than <code>etcetera</code> in English.</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>In English, <code>etcetera</code> tends to be treated in many cases as a bit of a cop-out.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s a way of not really saying exactly what you mean.</strong></p><p><strong>In Japanese it has much higher status. Its meaning spectrum is broader.</strong></p><p><strong>You will encounter it both in completely formal writing and in informal conversation and writing.</strong></p><p>It&#39;s an indispensable part of the language.</p><hr><p>To give an example of its <strong>formal use</strong>, a dictionary definition of the word <code>車窓</code> --</p><p>and <code>車窓</code> is one of these words that I&#39;ve talked about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaSPO5lL0yQ&amp;t=0s&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>in a previous video</strong></a>,</p><p>two-or-more-kanji words that really aren&#39;t words in quite the English sense of the word,</p><p>that&#39;s to say, <strong>they are really phrases</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>They bring together two known entities, which are known if we&#39;ve done much Japanese,</strong></p><p><strong>into what in English would simply be a phrase.</strong></p><p>So we can throw these words into our Anki if we want to remind ourselves that they exist</p><p>but <strong>we shouldn&#39;t treat them as completely new entities.</strong></p><p><strong>They&#39;re really just like phrases and this one is very close to the English phrase</strong></p><p><strong><code>car window</code>, which isn&#39;t a word, it&#39;s just a phrase.</strong></p><p>If we know <code>car</code> and we know <code>window</code>, we know what a <code>car window</code> is.</p><p>So if we know <code>車</code> and we know <code>窓</code> and we know the on-readings of the two,</p><p>which are <code>しゃ</code> and <code>そう</code>, then <code>しゃそう</code> really presents no problems,</p><p>except that <strong>we need to remember that <code>しゃ</code>, the on-reading of <code>車/くるま</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>refers to a broader range of vehicle.</strong></p><p><code>くるま</code> usually simply means a <code>自動車/じどうしゃ</code> (an automobile)</p><p><strong>while <code>しゃ</code> can refer to any kind of surface vehicle.</strong></p><p>A bicycle is a <code>自転車/じてんしゃ</code>, a train is a <code>電車/でんしゃ</code>, etcetera.</p><p>And the definition is: <code>自動車<strong>など</strong>の窓</code>.</p><p>So essentially that means <code>the window of an automobile, <strong>etcetera</strong></code>,</p><p>which <strong>in this case means any kind of a surface vehicle that has windows</strong>,</p><p>so not a <code>自転車</code> but a <code>電車</code>, etcetera: <code>the window of a vehicle</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Notice how the など here is used right after 自転車 (preceding even the の particle).<br> など seems to be used directly after its noun / noun phrase like any other particle would (など is a particle too). Furthermore however, looking at some Yomichan sentences where it is used, it seems like it takes priority over the logical particles like の, が, を in that it is the first one to attach to/after its attached noun, with the logical particles following it only once it was attached. As seen above or in a sentence from Yomichan:</p><blockquote><p>大学では<code><strong>フランス語やドイツ語</strong></code>など<code><strong>を</strong></code>勉強した。</p></blockquote></div><p>And this <code>など</code> is a very typical use of the word.<br><strong>It gets used freely in formal and informal Japanese.</strong></p><h3 id="など-in-informal-japanese" tabindex="-1">など in informal Japanese <a class="header-anchor" href="#など-in-informal-japanese" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;など in informal Japanese&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>In informal Japanese, <code>など</code> also has another use</strong>,</p><p><strong>which overlaps with the other two words we&#39;re going to look at.</strong></p><p><strong>It can be used to mildly denigrate or belittle a word that it&#39;s attached to.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <code>denigrate</code> and <code>belittle</code> are not exactly the right words to use here,</p><p>but I don&#39;t think there are quite the right words in English.</p><p><strong>It throws a negative light, which in the case of <code>など</code> is usually making light of</strong></p><p><strong>or slightly rejecting whatever it is.</strong></p><p>So we might say, <code>タバコ<strong>など</strong>不要だ</code>, which means <code>I&#39;ve no use for cigarettes</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>タバコは不要だ</code> would mean the same thing essentially</p><p><strong>(notice that <code>など</code> knocks out other particles)</strong>. <em>- so Dolly confirms my observation from above, except that here it straight-up removes the は particle, likely because it is not a logical particle.</em></p><hr><p><strong>The only difference here is that <code>など</code> is throwing</strong></p><p><strong>that slightly disparaging light on cigarettes.</strong></p><p>So the way we could read it is something like, in English, <code>I don&#39;t need stuff like cigarettes</code>.</p><p><strong>Now, actually this doesn&#39;t mean that literally.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s not saying I don&#39;t need cigarettes or cigars or a pipe or a hookah.</strong></p><p><strong>It means I don&#39;t need that kind of thing -- that&#39;s something I don&#39;t need in my life.</strong></p><p>And as I say, this use overlaps with our other two words.</p><p><strong>Both <code>なんか</code> and <code>なんて</code> can be used in this</strong></p><p><strong>throwing-a-negative-light-on-the-noun-they-follow way.</strong></p><p><strong>The strongest and most colloquial of the three is <code>なんか</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>and <code>なんて</code> comes somewhere in the middle.</strong></p><h2 id="なんか" tabindex="-1">なんか <a class="header-anchor" href="#なんか" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なんか&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>So, <code>なんか</code> is really a contraction of <code>何か/なにか</code> (something)</strong>,</p><p>but it has quite a few colloquial uses.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And it’s the denigrating one we&#39;ll hear sometimes very strongly in cases where...</p><p>well, let&#39;s say in an anime a younger sister is angry with her older sister.</p><p>She may say, <code>お姉ちゃん<strong>なんか</strong>大嫌い!</code> (I really hate <strong>stuff like</strong> my big sister).</p><p>Now, of course, <strong>that&#39;s not literally what she means.</strong></p><p><strong>She doesn&#39;t mean she hates <code>stuff like</code> her big sister,</strong></p><p><strong>but by using this expression --<code>stuff like you</code>, <code>stuff like my big sister</code> --</strong></p><p><strong>you&#39;re throwing a very disparaging light on what it is you&#39;re talking about.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>It can be milder:</strong> we can say, <code>サッカー<strong>なんか</strong>興味がない</code></p><p>(I&#39;ve no interest <strong>in stuff like</strong> soccer / I&#39;m not interested in soccer).</p><p><strong>And it can be more mildly belittling still:</strong> we might say, <code>雨なんか平気だ</code>.</p><p>And what we&#39;re saying there is &quot;<em>(Stuff/Something like)</em> Rain doesn&#39;t bother me /</p><p>I&#39;m not troubled by <em>(stuff/something like)</em> rain / I&#39;m okay with <em>(stuff/something like)</em> rain&quot;.</p><p><strong>And the <code>なんか</code> is just throwing that slightly diminishing light on the rain,</strong></p><p><strong>indicating how little we&#39;re worried about it.</strong></p><h3 id="なんか-used-with-oneself" tabindex="-1">なんか used with oneself <a class="header-anchor" href="#なんか-used-with-oneself" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なんか used with oneself&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And <strong>it often gets used of oneself</strong>, as in <code>私なんか</code>,</p><p>and <strong>this is often used to stress a perceived inferior position</strong></p><p><strong>or a difficult position that one finds oneself in</strong>, for example,</p><p><code>私なんかまるで子供扱いだ</code> (I&#39;m treated just like a child).</p><h3 id="なんか-contraction-of-なにか-何か" tabindex="-1">なんか - contraction of なにか / 何か <a class="header-anchor" href="#なんか-contraction-of-なにか-何か" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なんか - contraction of なにか / 何か&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Now, the fundamental meaning of <code>なんか</code>, as I said, is actually</strong></p><p><strong>a contraction of <code>なにか / 何か</code>, which is <code>something</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And <strong>it can be used simply as a contraction of <code>なにか / 何か</code></strong> in, for example,</p><p><code><strong>なんか</strong>心配はある?</code>, which just means <code><strong>何か</strong>心配はある</code> or</p><p>(Is there <strong>some</strong> worry? Is <strong>anything</strong> worrying you?).</p><h3 id="なんか-as-something-somewhat-to-make-things-vaguer" tabindex="-1">なんか as <code>something</code>, <code>somewhat</code> to make things vaguer <a

vaguer&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, <strong>from there it goes on to preface things in order, as with <code>something</code></strong></p><p><strong>or <code>somewhat</code> in English, to make them a bit vaguer.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we might say <code><strong>なんか</strong>違う</code> (<strong>something&#39;s</strong> different <em>/ <strong>something</strong> differs</em> --</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what it is, but something&#39;s different).</p><p><code>なんか違う.</code></p><h3 id="なんか-as-somehow-for-some-reason" tabindex="-1">なんか as <code>somehow / for some reason</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#なんか-as-somehow-for-some-reason" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なんか as &lt;code&gt;somehow / for some reason&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, from that it goes on to meaning <code>somehow</code>.</p><p>So we might say <code><strong>なんか</strong>好きじゃない</code> (<strong>somehow</strong>, I don&#39;t like it /</p><p><strong>For some reason</strong>, I don&#39;t like it).</p><p><code><strong>なんか</strong>好きじゃない</code></p><h3 id="なんか-in-very-casual-sloppy-speech-as-kinda-x" tabindex="-1">なんか in very casual / sloppy speech as <code>kinda</code> x <a

from there it gets worse.</p><p><strong>It goes on to become even vaguer.</strong></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>So in very casual and (I would say) rather sloppy speech,</strong></p><p><strong>you can hear <code>なんか</code> at the beginning of a sentence</strong></p><p><strong>and then several times during the sentence: <code>なんか this, なんか that</code>.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And when it&#39;s being used like that, it&#39;s really being used like <code>kinda</code> or <code>like</code> in English.</strong></p><p>And, just as in English, <strong>this is a sloppy way of talking.</strong></p><p>I<strong>t&#39;s not good Japanese, but you may hear people talking like this in some anime, etcetera.</strong></p><p><strong>The function really, as with <code>like</code> or <code>kinda</code> in English, is</strong></p><p><strong>simply vaguing things up a bit and</strong></p><p><strong>releasing oneself from the need to express oneself precisely.</strong></p><p>Just kinda saying, like, whatever it is that kinda comes into your mind, like --</p><p><code>なんか... なんか... なんか</code>.</p><p>So, <strong>we should look out for this very loose use of <code>なんか</code></strong></p><p><strong>and realize that it doesn&#39;t really mean very much at all.</strong></p><h2 id="なんて" tabindex="-1">なんて <a class="header-anchor" href="#なんて" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なんて&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong><code>なんて</code> is essentially a contraction of <code>何って</code></strong></p><p>and I&#39;ve done another video about this -って, which is a contraction of -と or <code>-という</code>.<br><em>(Lesson 18)</em></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And it&#39;s the same with <code>なんて</code>.</p><p>So, in its simplest and most basic use, it&#39;s used, for example,</p><p>in saying <code><strong>なんて</strong>言った?</code>, which means <code><strong>what</strong> did you say?</code></p><p>English speakers may be tempted to ask</p><p><code><strong>なにを</strong>いった?</code> (<strong>what</strong> did you say?).</p><p><strong>But that&#39;s not natural Japanese.</strong></p><p>We can say <code>なんと言った</code>, but it&#39;s actually <strong>more natural in casual speech</strong></p><p>to say <code><strong>なんて</strong>言った?</code> (<strong>what</strong> was it that you said?)</p><p>which isn&#39;t very easy to translate into English because</p><p>it&#39;s using that quotation particle <em>(the と)</em> even though</p><p><strong>it&#39;s rather morphed itself into <code>なんて</code> in colloquial speech.</strong></p><h3 id="なんて-as-what-a-this-or-what-a-that" tabindex="-1">なんて as <code>What a (this)</code> or <code>What a (that)</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#なんて-as-what-a-this-or-what-a-that" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なんて as &lt;code&gt;What a (this)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;What a (that)&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, you&#39;ll also see it a lot with a meaning of <code>what</code> in English</p><p>as used in expressions like <code><strong>What a</strong> nice day!</code>,</p><p><code><strong>What a</strong> stupid person!</code>, <code><strong>What a</strong> beautiful flower!</code> etcetera.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And this is an abbreviation of <code>なんという / 何という</code>, but it&#39;s more often than not,</strong></p><p><strong>even in not particularly casual speech, used as <code>なんて</code>.</strong></p><p><code><strong>なんて</strong>美しい景色だ!</code> (<strong>What</strong> beautiful scenery!)</p><p>And, just as in English, <strong>this <code>なんて</code> can be used to introduce</strong></p><p><strong>any fairly strong reaction to anything.</strong></p><p><strong>It can be negative; it can be positive.</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re saying <code>what a (this)</code> or <code>what a (that)</code>.</strong></p><h3 id="なんて-used-in-a-belittling-manner" tabindex="-1">なんて used in a belittling manner <a class="header-anchor" href="#なんて-used-in-a-belittling-manner" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なんて used in a belittling manner&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, <strong>it&#39;s also used</strong>, as we said before, <strong>in this belittling manner attached to a noun.</strong></p><p>So, for example, we can say <code>試験<strong>なんて</strong>嫌いだ</code> (I hate exams);</p><p><code>お金<strong>なんて</strong>いらない</code> (I don&#39;t want money).</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Like <code>なんか</code>, it both stresses the noun that it follows</strong></p><p><strong>and indicates a negative or a dismissive attitude towards it.</strong></p><h3 id="なんて-used-to-express-surprise" tabindex="-1">なんて used to express surprise <a class="header-anchor" href="#なんて-used-to-express-surprise" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なんて used to express surprise&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>And it can also be used at the end of a complete statement to express surprise.</strong></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So <strong>in this sense it&#39;s rather like the first one</strong> we looked at,</p><p><strong>the <code>what a (this)</code> or <code>what a (that)</code>, which comes at the beginning.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>It can also be used at the end to express surprise or in some cases disbelief or doubt.</strong></p><p>So we might say, <code>冬に燕を見る<strong>なんて</strong></code></p><p>(see a swallow in winter + <code>なんて</code>).</p><p>What&#39;s that <code>なんて</code> doing?</p><p>Well, <strong>it&#39;s turning the whole thing into an expression</strong>,</p><p><strong>rather like the <code>what a (this)</code> or <code>what a (that)</code> expressions.</strong></p><p><strong>So what we&#39;re saying is something like <code>Gosh, imagine seeing a swallow in winter!</code></strong></p><hr><p><strong>And this use of <code>なんて</code> on the end, after the engine of a statement,</strong></p><p><strong>can be used as part of a longer sentence.</strong></p><p>So, for example, we could say <code>腹を立てる<strong>なんて</strong>君らしくない</code>.</p><p>Now, <strong><code>腹を立てる</code></strong> means literally <code>stand your stomach</code>,</p><p><strong>but this is an expression meaning <code>get angry</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>So the whole thing is saying <code>getting angry, that&#39;s not like you</code>.</strong></p><p>And I&#39;ve talked about this <code>らしい</code> and <code>らしくない</code> in another video. <em>(Lesson 25)</em></p><p>So, if you&#39;re not familiar with those, I&#39;ll put a link above my head</p><p>and in the information section below.</p><hr><p>Now, <strong>we can take out the <code>なんて</code> here and then of course we&#39;d have to put in a particle</strong></p><p>and say, <code>腹を立てる<strong>のは</strong>君らしくない</code>.</p><p><strong>But the <code>なんて</code> is expressing our surprise about this</strong></p><p><strong>because it&#39;s not like the person concerned.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And note that this can&#39;t be the belittling <code>なんて</code>, which attaches to nouns.</strong></p><p><strong>This is attaching to a complete statement,</strong></p><p><strong>so we&#39;re expressing our surprise about someone being angry</strong></p><p><strong>and then adding the comment that it&#39;s not like her.</strong></p><h3 id="なんて-as-this-vague-という" tabindex="-1">なんて as this vague という <a class="header-anchor" href="#なんて-as-this-vague-という" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なんて as this vague という&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And finally, <strong>we can use it in a way that comes right back more or less</strong></p><p><strong>to the original meaning of <code>-という</code>, but adding a bit of vagueness to it.</strong></p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So if we say <code>山田<strong>なんて</strong>人は知らない</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>I don&#39;t know anyone <strong>called</strong> Yamada</code>.</p><p>Now, <strong>the <code>なんて</code> here could be replaced simply with <code>-という</code></strong>:</p><p><code>山田<strong>という</strong>人は知らない</code>.</p><p>So what&#39;s the difference between using the regular <code>-という</code> and using <code>なんて</code>?</p><hr><p>Well, <code>山田<strong>という</strong>人は知らない</code> is like saying in English simply</p><p><code>I don&#39;t know a person <strong>called</strong> Yamada</code>.</p><p>But <code>山田<strong>なんて</strong>人は知らない</code> is more like saying</p><p><code>I don&#39;t know any character <strong>called</strong> Yamada</code>.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s throwing a lot more doubt and questioning into the whole thing.</strong></p><p>So, we&#39;ve covered the main usages of these three words or expressions here.</p><p>It&#39;s not completely exhaustive, but I think it gives you the basic keys</p><p>to how they work, what they mean, how they&#39;re used.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Damn, quite a few sub-titles in this one, heh*
