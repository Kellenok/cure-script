40</em>),</p><p>if the て-form is <code>で</code> then instead of becoming <code>-ちゃった</code>, it becomes <code>-じゃった</code>, just in the way that <code>では</code> becomes <code>じゃ</code>.</p><p>Now, this has a much wider range of meanings than just <code>しまった</code> on its own.</p><p>It can be used for things that we did by accident or that we wish we hadn&#39;t done.</p><p>For example, we often say <code>忘れちゃった</code>, which is <code>忘れる</code> -- <code>forget</code> -- plus <code>-ちゃった</code>.</p><p>There&#39;s a famous song <code>ネコ踏んじゃった</code>, which is great fun, and I&#39;ll put a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpqGiKJt3cQ&amp;ab_channel=ichigoclub15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>link</strong></a> in the information section below.</p><p>And what that means is <code>I trod on the cat</code>: <code>踏む</code> -- to <code>tread (on something)</code>.</p><p>So we can see that it has a negative sense here, but it can also be something very good.</p><p>We might say <code>スーパーヒーローになっちゃった</code> -- <code>I became a superhero.</code></p><p>So what do these things have in common?</p><p>Accidental things, things we regret, things we&#39;re very pleased about.</p><p>The way I would put this, the way I would translate this into English, because this</p><p>is the English expression that I think covers practically all cases of <code>-ちゃった</code>, is the word <code>done</code>.</p><p><code>忘れちゃった</code> -- <code>I done forgot</code>; <code>猫踏んじゃった</code> -- <code>I done trod on the cat</code>;</p><p><code>スーパーヒーローになっちゃった</code> -- <code>I done became a superhero.</code></p><p>In all these cases , the idea is very similar.</p><p>We&#39;re saying that it happened, it&#39;s done, it&#39;s completed, it&#39;s a fact, and the implication generally speaking is that we didn&#39;t expect it to be a fact or it wasn&#39;t what most people would normally have expected to be a fact, but it is. It <code>done happened</code>.</p><p>And if we understand that, it&#39;s very easy to understand all the different kinds of circumstances under which <code>-ちゃった</code> gets used.</p><p>The only real difference between this and <code>done</code> in English is that we don&#39;t only use it about past things. We also use it about future things.</p><p>So we can say, <code>夏休みが終わってしまう</code> and that means <code>the summer vacation will done end</code>.</p><p>Now, of course you can&#39;t say that in English but that essentially is what you&#39;re saying.</p><p>It will just be and go and end.</p><p>That&#39;s what&#39;ll happen and it&#39;ll be done and there&#39;s nothing we&#39;ll be able to do about it.</p><p>If you&#39;re about to tell somebody something embarrassing, you might say</p><p><code>君のは笑っちゃうだろう</code> -- <code>You&#39;ll probably laugh</code></p><p>or <code>You&#39;ll probably done laugh / You&#39;ll probably just up and laugh.</code></p><p>Again, it&#39;s the same idea but in Japanese we can project that idea into the future as well.</p><p>We can say <code>今日はどんどん飲んじゃう</code>, and that&#39;s <code>Today, I&#39;m going to drink like crazy</code>.</p><p><code>どんどん</code> is <code>one after another in rapid succession</code>; <code>飲んじゃう</code> is <code>done drink</code>.</p><p>Again, we can&#39;t put that in the future in English, but we can put it in the future in Japanese.</p><p>So if we understand how these work, we don&#39;t have to have a lot of complicated explanations</p><p>of all their different cases.</p><p>They work in the same way all the time if we only think about what is the way they work</p><p>rather than what their end result is if you translate it into English.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>',77)]))}const y=t(h,[["render",p]]);export{f as __pageData,y as default};
