work | 見る、見られる、見れる、見える、聞く、聞ける、聞こえる | Lesson 54</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about some exceptions in Japanese,</p><p>how they work, and why they&#39;re there.</p><p>And in doing that, I think we&#39;re going to gain some insight into</p><p>how Japanese holds together and how we can understand it.</p><p>So what we&#39;re going to talk about today is</p><p>見る, 見られる, 見れる, 見える, 聞く, 聞ける, 聞こえる.</p><p>Now, that seems like quite a confusing lot of things, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p>But in fact all we have there is the basic dictionary forms</p><p>of <code>見る</code> and <code>聞く</code> -- <code>see</code> and <code>hear</code> -- and the potential form of each</p><p>and one alternative or exceptional potential form.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, it looks like two in the case of <code>見る</code>, but it&#39;s actually one,</p><p>and we&#39;ll come to that in just a moment.</p><p>I always say that Japanese is a very, very regular and logical language,</p><p>and the conventional wisdom is that it only has two irregular verbs, <code>来る</code> and <code>する</code>.</p><p>Now, as I&#39;ve mentioned before, it does in fact have a few other minor irregularities,</p><p>and by minor irregularities what I mean is verbs that aren&#39;t really irregular verbs but</p><p>they do become irregular in one particular area, in one single place only.</p><p>And there aren&#39;t many of these, but there are a few and these are two of them.</p><p>And we want to look at what they are and, more importantly,</p><p>why they are what they are and what they mean,</p><p>how we can understand them.</p><p>So to start with, we understand how the regular potential form,</p><p>the <code>able to do</code> form, of verbs work, don&#39;t we?</p><p>We form it simply by turning the verb into its え-stem and</p><p>adding the very simple potential helper verb <code>る</code>, which is just one character: る.</p><p>That&#39;s the godan form.</p><p>And the ichidan form: in the ichidan we do what we always do,</p><p>we simply remove the -る and put on whatever it is we&#39;re going to put on.</p><p>In this case, the ichidan potential helper is <code></code>られる<code></code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, as we can see, <code>見られる</code> is the regular potential form of <code>見る</code>,</p><p>which is an ichidan verb, and</p><p><code>聞ける</code> is the regular potential form of <code>聞く</code>, which is of course a godan verb.</p><p>So why am I saying that there&#39;s only one variant of <code>見る</code> and not two?</p><p>Well, that&#39;s because the variant is <code>見える</code>, and we&#39;ll come back to that in a moment.</p><p><code>見れる</code> is in fact the ichidan form being affected by a phenomenon which we call <code>ら抜き</code>. <code>ら抜き</code> means literally <code>taking out the ら</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And this is something that happens quite widely in Japanese.</p><p>You&#39;re going to encounter it pretty often once you&#39;re actually using Japanese,</p><p>so that may be right now.</p><p>It simply consists of taking out the <code>ら</code>, dropping the <code>ら</code>,</p><p>in the ichidan potential form of verbs.</p><p>This is considered to be incorrect grammar, not only by the English Japanese textbooks</p><p>but also by native Japanese grammar textbooks.</p><p>It&#39;s considered to be incorrect grammar, but it&#39;s very, very widespread,</p><p>much more widespread than most of the popular bits of incorrect grammar</p><p>that you&#39;ll hear from time to time.</p><p>And I would suggest that this is probably going to be an evolution of the language.</p><p>Now, Western people often tend to say, &quot;Well, if a number of people</p><p>are using an incorrect usage then how can you say it&#39;s incorrect?</p><p>Surely it&#39;s a new correct usage, because <strong>correct</strong> is just what people use.&quot;</p><p>And I think this is a mistake and a rather dangerous and irresponsible mistake,</p><p>because while it&#39;s true that language evolves, the evolution of language is pretty much the same as the theorized evolution of species.</p><p>That&#39;s to say, species evolve from mutations.</p><p>Mutations happen relatively often and most of them die out.</p><p>Only a few of them, and usually in cases where they have some special advantage,</p><p>actually persist and become part of the evolution of the species.</p><p>And the same is true of languages.</p><p>Most incorrect usages that get taken up by largish numbers of people die out.</p><p>Only a very few of them ever become parts of the real evolution of the language.</p><p>So if you do what is currently being done in the West, which is put in misuses of language into dictionaries, what you&#39;re doing is actually short-circuiting the self-correcting function of language.</p><p>Language over a generation or so, over maybe a couple of decades,</p><p>will reject most uses that go against its basic logic.</p><p>A very few of them will end up making minor changes in the basic logic.</p><p>And that&#39;s why it&#39;s a mistake to put into dictionaries at an early stage</p><p>misuses of language, because we have no way of knowing at that early stage</p><p>whether they&#39;re really going to be genuine evolutions of language</p><p>or whether they&#39;re going to die out within a generation.</p><p>What we do know is that in most cases, in the vast majority of cases,</p><p>they would die out within a generation, and by putting them into a dictionary we&#39;re interfering with that self-correcting process of language.</p><p>And this, I would say, is important, because it&#39;s this way of thinking</p><p>that makes Japanese teaching so very poor in the West.</p><p>It&#39;s the way of thinking that assumes that language is a completely irrational thing</p><p>that just happens to evolve in any way it chooses to evolve.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And it&#39;s not. Language is governed by logic.</p><p>And Japanese is governed by logic more than most languages.</p><p>But if you reject that notion, if you think that language is simply irrational</p><p>and chance and accidental and anything anybody happens to use is as correct as anything else,</p><p>then you end up teaching language as if it were just a hodgepodge of things</p><p>that you have to learn because they just happen to be there</p><p>and don&#39;t have any underlying logic.</p><p>And that really is the fallacy that underlies modern Western Japanese teaching.</p><p>So, that&#39;s a digression.</p><p>Let&#39;s get back to <code>見られる</code>.</p><p><code>見られる</code> is what they&#39;ll use, because that is currently the correct usage.</p><p>So we have <code>見る</code>, we have <code>見られる</code><code>, and </code>見える&quot;.</p><p>We have <code>聞く</code>, we have <code>聞ける</code> and we have <code>聞こえる</code>.</p><h2 id="regular-and-irregular-potential-form" tabindex="-1">Regular and irregular potential form <a class="header-anchor" href="#regular-and-irregular-potential-form" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Regular and irregular potential form&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So what is the difference between the two potential forms,</p><p>the regular and the irregular potential form?</p><p>Now, in each case here, the irregular potential form is what I&#39;m going to call a forced self-move form.</p><p>Now, as we know from our lesson on the potential <em>(Lesson 10)</em>, potential is usually self-move -- and if you don&#39;t know what <code>self-move</code> is,</p><p>you should look at the lesson on self-move and other-move verbs too <em>(Lesson 15)</em>.</p><p>They sometimes get called, not exactly accurately, transitive and intransitive.</p><p>So, for example, if we want to say <code>I can read the book</code>,</p><p>in Japanese we actually say <code>the book does readable to me</code>.</p><p>So we say <code>*(私は)*本が読める</code>. This is self-move.</p><p>The book is the actor and it&#39;s acting upon itself.</p><p>It&#39;s making itself readable, it&#39;s <code>doing readable</code> literally.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The furigana of 私 should be わたし.</p></div><p>There&#39;s no exact English translation for this,</p><p>because we&#39;re not saying the book IS readable;</p><p>it&#39;s not an adjectival phrase.</p><p>We&#39;re saying the book DOES readable.</p><p>So we just have to get used to the fact that Japanese is much more happy than English</p><p>to treat states of being as verbal actions.</p><p>So if we want to say <code>I can read the book/<em>As for me, the book does readable</em></code>,<br> we say <code>*(私は)*本が読める</code>,</p><p>but if we just want to say <code>I can read*/I do readable*</code>,<br> we might say <code>読める</code> or <code>(私は)私が読める</code>,</p><p>and again we have a self-move verb.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In one case we&#39;re saying <code>I do readable (I am able to read)</code>,</p><p>in the other we say <code>the book does readable (the book does being able to be read)</code></p><p>and that&#39;s how it works.</p><p>However, it is also possible to use the potential in other-move contexts.</p><p>Usually this happens in modifying clauses.</p><p>These are sometimes called by Western textbooks <code>subordinate clauses</code>,</p><p>which they are, but I think it&#39;s better and clearer to call them <code>modifying clauses</code>,</p><p>and I&#39;ve done quite a lot of work on modifying clauses,</p><p>so I&#39;d recommend this video if you want to know exactly what I mean.</p><p>So, in modifying clauses particularly</p><p>we can use the potential as an other-move verb.</p><p>For example, we might say <code>さくらを見られる日を楽しみにしている</code></p><p>This means <code>I&#39;m looking forward to the day when I can see Sakura.</code></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And as you see, here we&#39;re saying <code>さくらを見られる</code>, using <code>見られる</code>, the potential,</p><p><code>being able to see Sakura</code>, as an other-move verb with an object, which is Sakura.</p><p>Now, we can do that with <code>見られる</code>, we can do that with <code>聞ける</code>,</p><p>but we can&#39;t do it with <code>見える</code> or <code>聞こえる</code>.</p><p>They are forced to be used as self-move verbs only.</p><p>And on the whole, because potential verbs mostly are self-move in Japanese,</p><p>whether we&#39;re talking about something else or whether we&#39;re talking about ourselves,</p><p>we use them in a self-move manner, those two are the most commonly used.</p><p>Actually we can use the other forms, the regular forms,</p><p><code>見られる</code> and <code>聞ける</code>, as self-move verbs too,</p><p>but they can also be used as other-move verbs.</p><hr><p>With <code>見える</code> and <code>見られる</code>, there is a difference in nuance, which is that</p><p><code>見える</code> usually means being able, actually physically able, to see something,</p><p>and <code>見られる</code> more implies having the opportunity to see something.</p><p>So if we were to say <code>芝居/しばいが見られる</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying I have the opportunity to see the play.</p><p>If we say <code>芝居が見える</code>, we might mean</p><p>the lady in front of me has taken off her big hat so I&#39;m able to see the play.</p><p>However, this alone wouldn&#39;t be, I think, sufficient reason</p><p>for these two variants of the words surviving into modern Japanese.</p><p>The important reason, which is based in the very nature of seeing and hearing</p><p>and expressions we use in connection with seeing and hearing, is this:</p><p>they are both used in places where in English we would say</p><p>that something <code>looks like</code> something or something <code>sounds like</code> something.</p><p>You can&#39;t use the standard versions <code>聞ける</code> and <code>見られる</code>&quot; for this.</p><p>You have to use these variants.</p><p>So if you say <code>さくらはカエルに見える</code>, you&#39;re saying <code>Sakura looks like a frog</code>.</p><p>So when we say <code>looks like</code>, we use the targeting particle に with a noun,</p><p>or with an adjective we use the く-stem of the adjective.</p><p>So we say <code>カエルに見える</code> -- <code>looks like a frog</code> --</p><p>or we can say of someone <code>若く見える</code> -- <code>she looks young</code>.</p><hr><p>And we can also use it not just for literally how something sounds to our ears</p><p>or for how something looks to our eyes, but what its appearance is.</p><p>So we can say <code>奇妙/きみょうに聞こえる</code> -- <code>it sounds strange / sounds peculiar</code>.</p><p>So, we&#39;re not talking here necessarily about the actual sound.</p><p>It might not be a noise that sounds strange.</p><p>It may be something somebody said that sounds strange.</p><hr><p>So we&#39;re using either the adverbial form of an adjective or the adjective-making targeting particle に to describe how something appears to us, how something sounds to us, literally or figuratively.</p><p>And this is the real reason for the survival of these alternative forms of the potential.</p><p>They have this specific meaning, which the other form, the regular form, can&#39;t have.</p><p>And it&#39;s not a coincidence that it&#39;s this forced, must-be self-move version</p><p>that takes on that meaning, because the way something else looks,</p><p>the way something else sounds, always has to be self-move.</p><p>We&#39;re not talking about anything we do to the look or anything we do to the sound,</p><p>but about how it looks and sounds in itself.</p><p>So this extremely self-move version <em>(見える/聞こえる)</em>, which can&#39;t be used in other-move contexts, is what is used in the case of both seeing and hearing to describe</p><p>how something sounds to us and how something looks to us.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>in the comments, Dolly-先生 mentions some important point that did not make it into the video, given on her Patreon.
