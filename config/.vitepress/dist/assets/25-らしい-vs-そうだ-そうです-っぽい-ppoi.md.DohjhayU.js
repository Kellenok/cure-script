Rashii vs sou desu. らしい vs そうです. っぽい ppoi</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Last week <em>(Lesson 24)</em> we talked about the helper adjectival noun <code>そう</code> and how we use it to express what something might be like, our impression of something, and hearsay.</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about other ways of expressing a similar range of ideas,</p><p>how they work, how they are similar, and how they are different.</p><h2 id="らしい" tabindex="-1">らしい <a class="header-anchor" href="#らしい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;らしい&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, we&#39;re going to look at <strong><code>らしい</code>, which is a helper adjective.</strong></p><p>And <strong>this is an adjective ending in -しい</strong>, which is what we can call a <strong>subclass of adjectives</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>All real adjectives, as you know, end in -い.</p><p>So-called adjectives that don&#39;t end in -い are in fact adjectival nouns. <em>(such as きれい/綺麗)</em></p><p>But a group of those い-ending adjectives ends with -しい. <em>(I guess some of the <code>real</code> adj.)</em></p><p>As you see, <strong>it&#39;s still ending in -い but it also has -し, so it&#39;s -しい.</strong></p><p>And the characteristic of this group of adjectives is that</p><p><strong>on the whole they express subjectivities.</strong></p><p>That is to say, <strong>not exact measurable qualities but things which are to some extent dependent upon human or other sentient beings&#39; impression of them.</strong></p><p>So, for example, <code>かな/悲しい</code> is <code>sad</code>; <code>うれ/嬉しい</code> is <code>happy</code>.</p><p><code>むずか/難しい</code> means <code>difficult</code> and while this seems somewhat more objective than <code>嬉しい</code></p><p>and <code>悲しい</code>, <strong>it&#39;s still in some way a subjectivity because difficulty is relative to particular individuals.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Whether you find a thing difficult or easy depends to a large extent on</strong></p><p><strong>who you are and what your abilities are.</strong></p><p>So this, as we&#39;ll see, gives us an indication of what kind of a word this is and how it differs from<br><code>そう</code>.</p><p>Its use is very simple.</p><p><strong>Like <code>そう</code> it can be attached either to an individual word or</strong></p><p><strong>to a complete logical clause or sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And the attachment is absolutely simple, because we never do anything at all except</p><p><strong>just put <code>らしい</code> after the word or after the completed logical clause.</strong></p><p><strong>We don&#39;t change anything, we don&#39;t do anything, so it really couldn&#39;t be easier.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <strong>as with <code>そう</code>, if we put it after a single word</strong></p><p><strong>we are talking about our impressions of that particular object.</strong></p><p><strong>If we put it after a completed clause</strong>, we are saying <code><strong>it seems to be that way</strong></code>.</p><h2 id="difference-between-らしい-そうだ-です" tabindex="-1">Difference between らしい &amp; そうだ/です <a class="header-anchor" href="#difference-between-らしい-そうだ-です" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Difference between らしい &amp; そうだ/です&quot;">​</a></h2><p>However, there is a difference.</p><p>If we put <code>そうだ</code> after a completed clause, as you know, we complete the clause, if necessary with another <code>だ</code>, and that usage means that</p><p><strong>we&#39;ve heard that that sentence is the case.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="らしい-vs-そうだ-after-a-complete-clause" tabindex="-1">らしい vs そうだ - after a complete clause <a class="header-anchor" href="#らしい-vs-そうだ-after-a-complete-clause" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;らしい vs そうだ - after a complete clause&quot;">​</a></h3><p>So if we say, <code>あの動物はウサギだそうだ</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I&#39;ve heard that that animal is a rabbit</code>.</p><p>Now, if we say, <code>あの動物はウサギだ<strong>らしい</strong></code>, we&#39;re saying <code><strong>It seems</strong> that animal is a rabbit</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <strong>that can mean the same thing as</strong> <code>ウサギだ<strong>そうだ</strong></code>.</p><p>It can mean <code>I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s a rabbit</code>, and sometimes the textbooks get quite convoluted</p><p>and confusing about whether <code>らしい</code> actually means</p><p><code>I&#39;ve heard</code> or whether it means <code>it seems</code>,</p><p>but it&#39;s very simple if you understand exactly what it&#39;s doing.</p><p><strong>What it&#39;s doing is actually saying <code>it appears</code> or <code>it seems</code>, and this has exactly the same ambiguity and lack of ambiguity as that has in English.</strong></p><p>So let&#39;s take the case of this mysterious animal.</p><p>Suppose I&#39;m looking at it with a group of people and afterwards you come up to me and say, <code>What is that animal?</code> and I say, <code>ウサギだ<strong>らしい</strong></code>.</p><p>Now, I&#39;ve given <strong>a complete sentence with <code>らしい</code> on the end</strong>,</p><p>and the natural meaning here would be <code><strong>I heard from those people that</strong> it was a rabbit.</code></p><hr><p>Now, you see this is just the same as if in English I say, <code><strong>It appears that</strong> it&#39;s a rabbit.</code></p><p>Now, you would take me, in English and in Japanese, to be saying,</p><p><code><strong>From what I heard (from those people)</strong>, it&#39;s a rabbit</code>.</p><p>Now, take a different scenario.</p><p>The rabbit&#39;s gone and I&#39;m examining its footprints and you come up to me and say,</p><p><code>What was that animal?</code> and I say, <code>ウサギだった<strong>らしい</strong></code>.</p><p>Again, <code><strong>It appears that</strong> it was a rabbit</code>, or <code><strong>It seems that</strong> it was a rabbit.</code></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In this case, you would probably conclude from what I&#39;m doing that by saying</p><p><code><strong>It appears</strong> it was a rabbit</code>, I&#39;m saying,</p><p><code><strong>From the evidence I&#39;m looking at here, the appearances are that</strong> it&#39;s a rabbit.</code></p><p>So you see, there&#39;s nothing particularly grammatical or complicated about this.</p><p>It&#39;s just the same as in English if you said</p><p><code>It appears that it&#39;s a rabbit</code> or <code>It seems that it&#39;s a rabbit</code>,</p><p><strong>it depends on context whether that implies that that&#39;s the information you&#39;ve heard</strong></p><p><strong>or that that&#39;s the conclusion you&#39;re drawing from your observations.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>If you want to be completely unambiguous that you&#39;re talking about hearsay,</strong></p><p><strong>that you&#39;re talking about something you heard from other people</strong>, then you say,<br><code>ウサギだった<strong>そうだ</strong></code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That is unambiguous. That can only mean <code><strong>I heard it from somebody</strong></code>.</p><h3 id="らしい-vs-そうだ-an-individual-word" tabindex="-1">らしい vs そうだ - an individual word <a class="header-anchor" href="#らしい-vs-そうだ-an-individual-word" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;らしい vs そうだ - an individual word&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, when we apply <code>らしい</code> to an individual word,</p><p>the most immediate difference between <code>らしい</code> and <code>そうだ</code> is that</p><p><strong>we can&#39;t apply <code>そうだ</code> to a regular noun.</strong></p><p><strong>We can only apply it to an adjectival noun</strong>, and there&#39;s a good reason for that.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We&#39;ll get to it in a moment.</p><p><strong><code>らしい</code> you can apply to any kind of noun,</strong></p><p><strong>whether it&#39;s an adjectival noun or whether it&#39;s a regular noun.</strong></p><p>But it really comes into its own when it&#39;s being applied to regular nouns.</p><hr><p>As you would expect from the fact that <strong>it is a -しい adjective</strong></p><p>– that&#39;s to say, that we would expect it to be expressing a greater degree of subjectivity – <strong>it has the ability to liken one thing to another.</strong></p><p>So we can say <code>あの動物はウサギ<strong>らしい</strong></code> –</p><p><code>That animal <strong>is</strong> rabbit**-like** / that animal**&#39;s like** a rabbit.</code></p><hr><p>Now, the difference between this and <code>そう</code>, apart from the fact that you can only apply</p><p><code>そう</code> to adjectival nouns – and this is why you can only apply <code>そう</code> to adjectival nouns –</p><p>is that when we say <code>あの動物はウサギ<strong>らしい</strong></code></p><p><strong>we are not necessarily conjecturing that it is in fact a rabbit.</strong></p><p><strong>We may be completely aware that it isn&#39;t a rabbit</strong> and we&#39;re simply saying</p><p>that it**&#39;s like** a rabbit, it**&#39;s** a rabbit**-like** animal.</p><p>And of course, <strong>we can turn it around into that kind of an adjective too:</strong></p><p><code>ウサギ<strong>らしい</strong>動物</code> – <code>a rabbit**-like** animal</code>.</p><p>And again, it&#39;s just the same as in English.</p><p>If we say, <code>That animal <strong>looks like</strong> a rabbit</code>, we could mean <code><strong>I&#39;m guessing that it is</strong> a rabbit</code></p><p>or we could mean <code>It&#39;s probably not a rabbit, but it certainly looks like one.</code></p><p>Now, this widens out into even greater areas of subjectivity.</p><h3 id="らしい-for-more-subjective-areas" tabindex="-1">らしい for more subjective areas <a class="header-anchor" href="#らしい-for-more-subjective-areas" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;らしい for more subjective areas&quot;">​</a></h3><p>For example, <strong>we can say that something has the qualities of something.</strong></p><p>For example, <code>男<strong>らしい</strong>男</code> is a <code>manly man</code>, a man <strong>who possesses the qualities of</strong> a man.</p><p>If we talk about someone who&#39;s not a teacher and we say</p><p><code>先生<strong>らしい</strong></code> – <code>That person**&#39;s like** a teacher.</code></p><p><strong>We might or might not be conjecturing that she is in fact a teacher.</strong></p><hr><p>But if we know that she&#39;s a teacher and we say, <code>さくら先生は先生<strong>らしい</strong></code>,</p><p>we mean that she <strong>behaves like</strong> a teacher.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>She is a teacher and she has the right qualities and manner for being a teacher.</strong></p><hr><p>Conversely, we could say, <code>さくら先生は、先生<strong>らしくない</strong></code> and in that case, we&#39;re saying, <code>Well, we know she&#39;s a teacher, but she <strong>doesn&#39;t behave like</strong> one, she <strong>doesn&#39;t act like</strong> a teacher.</code></p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So you see, <strong>with <code>らしい</code> we are getting into much more subjective areas.</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re not simply guessing whether something is in fact delicious or interesting,</strong></p><p><strong>which we can confirm by experience.</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re talking about our impressions and beliefs and subjectivities surrounding the phenomenon.</strong></p><p>Now, we can also say things like, for example,</p><p>if Sakura says something unpleasant and usually she&#39;s a very sweet girl, we might say,</p><p><code>それはさくら<strong>らしくない</strong></code> – <code>That <strong>wasn&#39;t / <em>isn&#39;t</em> like</strong> you, Sakura.</code></p><p><strong>So we&#39;re talking about the qualities, the subjectively perceived qualities of a thing.</strong></p><p>So, <strong>in some areas it overlaps with <code>そうだ</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>but in other areas it moves forward into more subtle and subjective areas.</strong></p><h2 id="っぽい" tabindex="-1">っぽい <a class="header-anchor" href="#っぽい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;っぽい&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, we&#39;re also going to quickly look at っぽい, which is a small っ followed by -ぽい,</p><p>so we have a little break between that and what we&#39;re saying.</p><p>So if we want to say <code>child<strong>ish</strong></code>, we might say <code>子ども<strong>っぽい</strong></code>.</p><p><strong>It works very much like <code>らしい</code>. It&#39;s also a helper adjective.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s much more casual than <code>らしい</code></strong> and we usually hear it in exactly that form –<br><code>子ども<strong>っぽい</strong></code>, <code>ウサギ<strong>っぽい</strong></code>.</p><hr><p><strong>You can&#39;t use っぽい at the end of a completed clause. You can only attach it to a word.</strong></p><p>And apart from its colloquial nature, a difference in tendency from <code>らしい</code> is that</p><p><strong><code>らしい</code> will tend to imply that the quality is what something ought to have.</strong></p><p><strong>-っぽい often tends to imply the opposite.</strong> <em>(basically, it tends to imply an undesirable quality)</em></p><hr><p>There&#39;s no hard-and-fast rule here,</p><p>but <strong>there tends to be a positive inclination in <code>らしい</code> and a negative one in っぽい</strong>,<br><strong>although you will certainly hear them used the other way round on some occasions.</strong></p><p>So <code>子ども<strong>らしい</strong></code> <strong>is more likely to imply the child&#39;s behaving in a way proper to a child</strong>,</p><p>whereas <code>子ども<strong>っぽい</strong></code> tends to mean <code>child<strong>ish</strong></code>.</p><p>In fact, in English we could say <code>子ども<strong>らしい</strong></code> means <code>child**-like**</code></p><p>and <code>子ども<strong>っぽい</strong></code> means <code>child<strong>ish</strong></code>, although it&#39;s not as hard and fast as that is in English.</p><p><strong>It could be used the other way round without breaking any actual laws.</strong></p><p>When I first appeared in this particular shell, this body that I&#39;m wearing now</p><p>– I am of course the ghost in the shell <em>(nice reference there, Dolly 😄)</em> –</p><p>I was talking in English, introducing it, but I made a little aside in Japanese because I really don&#39;t know quite how to say this in English.</p><p>I said, &quot;What do you think of me when I look like this?</p><p><code>人間っぽいね?</code></p><p><code>人間<strong>っぽい</strong>ね</code> – <code>It&#39;s very human**-looking**, isn&#39;t it?</code></p><p>And while it wasn&#39;t exactly disparaging, the sense of what I was saying was</p><p><code>Good heavens, in this shell I <strong>look really more</strong> human <strong>than I actually am</strong>, don&#39;t I?</code></p><p>Which I think is why some people call me <code>creepy</code>, because I&#39;m probably just a little bit too</p><p>human-looking for someone who isn&#39;t human.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>It can get a bit tricky to say which translation parts I should highlight so as to correspond to what Dolly gives in 日本語, but hopefully it helps, I try to deduce it as best as I can (p^-^)p<br> **Anyway, from here on, I will not use these underlines until around Lesson 78.</p></div><p>The later lessons will have them again, these lessons in-between do not have them because I used just bolding back then and did not add underlines until later, hence no lines on them for now.***</p><p>***Also, lessons from now up to 64 are among the first I edited, and I have not reviewed the notes there yet, so keep that in mind and take them with salt as usual just in case since my Japanese is still very limited and I have not got any more professional / advanced people’s feedback on them.<br> *<em>The reason also then being that I was (and still sort am) not entirely sure whether I should or should not use them (Yomichan does not want to properly scan differently styled parts, 10ten does though…<br> It took a lot of time and work to underline the important parts, so maybe I will return to it later to make it consistent at least.<br> If you can, please let me know through Discord or Mail whether you prefer underlined important parts or simply non-underlined text since sometimes the amount of <code>important stuff</code> may be a bit harder to read when everything is underlined. With bold it was even worse, hence why I stopped using it and converted.</em></p>',160)]))}const x=t(w,[["render",y]]);export{j as __pageData,x as default};
