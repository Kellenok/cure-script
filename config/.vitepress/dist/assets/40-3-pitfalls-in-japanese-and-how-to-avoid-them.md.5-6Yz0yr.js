Is it the logical particle or is it the て-form of the copula?</p><p>This is the て-form of the copula, not the particle.</p><p>The particle doesn&#39;t make any sense here, does it?</p><p>What&#39;s the て-form of the copula doing?</p><p>Well, we know, don&#39;t we, that the て-form is often used to make an imperative,</p><p>to tell someone or ask someone to do something.</p><p>So, if we say <code>待って</code> -- <code>wait</code> -- this is kind of short for <code>待ってください</code> and we&#39;re</p><p>asking someone to wait (<code>待って!</code> -- <code>Wait!</code>).</p><p>Now, it&#39;s exactly the same with <code>で</code>, which is the て-form of the copula.</p><p>So, <code>元気だ</code> means <code>is 元気</code>, someone is genki, someone is healthy or lively.</p><p><code>元気で</code> is telling them to *be* genki or lively.</p><p><code>お元気で</code> -- <code>be healthy / be lively / keep up the good spirits</code>.</p><h3 id="無事-ぶじで" tabindex="-1">無事/ぶじで <a class="header-anchor" href="#無事-ぶじで" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;無事/ぶじで&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Right. So here&#39;s another one: <code>無事でよかった</code> is another very common expression and it means</p><p><code>I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re all right / it&#39;s good that you weren&#39;t harmed / it&#39;s good that you&#39;re safe</code></p><p>-- <code>無事でよかった</code>. What do we have here?</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Once again, we have the て-form of the copula.</p><p><code>無事</code>, which means literally <code>no incident</code> and therefore it means<br><code>nothing happened / nothing bad happened / you weren&#39;t harmed / you&#39;re safe.</code></p><p>So, <code>無事だ</code> means <code>you&#39;re safe / you weren&#39;t harmed / nothing happened</code>.</p><p><code>無事で</code> is turning that <code>だ</code>, that copula, into the connective form.</p><p>We use the て-form to connect things, don&#39;t we?</p><p>So, just as we might say, <code>遅くなってすみません</code> -- <code>That I came late, I&#39;m sorry</code>--</p><p>we also say <code>無事でよかった</code> -- <code>That you weren&#39;t hurt, that was good.</code></p><p>And this connective て-form is also used in longer compound sentences.</p><p>So, for example, we might say <code>さくらはいい子で毎日学校に行く</code> --</p><p><code>Sakura is a good child and she goes to school every day.</code></p><p>We have two complete clauses and, just as with the て-form of any verb, we can use it</p><p>to connect that verb-ending clause to a second clause, so we can do exactly the same thing with the copula.</p><p>So, <code>さくらがいい子だ</code> -- <code>Sakura&#39;s a good girl</code> -- is a complete sentence in itself.</p><p>If we want to connect it to a second clause to make it the first half of a compound sentence, we turn that <code>だ</code> into its て-form, <code>で</code>.</p><p>So, <code>Sakura is a good girl and she goes to school every day.</code></p><p>And as is usual with the て-form connector, it tends to imply a positive relation between the two.</p><p>It has this implication of <code>Because Sakura&#39;s a good girl, she goes to school every day,</code></p><p>but it&#39;s not stating it as strongly as if we&#39;d used <code>から</code>.</p><hr><p>Now, another confusion, which is not kept such a deep, dark secret by the textbooks,</p><p>but they don&#39;t always stress it clearly enough, and it&#39;s very important because it concerns</p><p>the very center of the Japanese language, and that is the が-particle.</p><h2 id="が-clause-connector" tabindex="-1">が clause connector <a class="header-anchor" href="#が-clause-connector" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;が clause connector&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The が-particle, as we know, is the one particle that no sentence or clause in Japanese can ever be without, whether we can see it or whether we can&#39;t.</p><p><code>が</code> marks the A-car of every sentence, the do-er of an A-does-B clause and the be-er of an A-is-B clause.</p><p>But there is also another <code>が</code>.</p><p>It&#39;s not easy to confuse the two, provided you&#39;re clearly aware of them.</p><p>The other <code>が</code> is also a clause connector.</p><p>And usually it&#39;s a contrastive clause connector.</p><p>So, if we say, <code>お店に行ったがパンがなかった,</code> we&#39;re saying <code>I went to the shops, but there wasn&#39;t any bread.</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The second が is the particle version of が for its logical clause, marking パン.</p></div><p>So, this is a contrastive conjunction.</p><p>We went to the shops hoping that there would be bread, but there wasn&#39;t any.</p><p>It&#39;s not possible to confuse this with the other <code>が</code>, the <code>が</code> that marks the subject</p><p>of the sentence, the A-car, because that <code>が</code>, the particle <code>が</code>, can only ever mark a noun.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And the clause-connector <code>が</code> can only ever mark a complete sentence.</p><p>The particle <code>が</code> can&#39;t mark a complete sentence, because a complete sentence can&#39;t end with a noun.</p><p>It has to end with a verb, an adjective, or a copula, as we learned in our very first lesson.</p><p>So it&#39;s not possible to confuse these two so long as you&#39;re clearly aware of them.</p><p>One more thing that we should note is that <code>が</code> doesn&#39;t have to be contrastive.</p><p>Most of the time it is, but it can be used as a regular, non-contrastive conjunction.</p><p>It&#39;s worth knowing that, because if you see it connecting two clauses and there doesn&#39;t</p><p>seem to be any contrast there, you don&#39;t have to rack your brains to find the contrast -- occasionally it is used in a non-contrastive manner.<br> And the other thing you need to know is that</p><p>you will sometimes find this contrastive <code>が</code> at the end of a sentence.</p><p>And I have talked before about sentences that end in a conjunction.</p><p>Strictly, they&#39;re not complete, because what they&#39;re doing is implying a following clause.</p><p><code>が</code> at the end of a sentence is often a politeness, because <code>が</code> is in fact more polite than <code>けど</code> or <code>でも</code>, the other ways of saying <code>but</code>.</p><p>So if we said something like <code><em>(私は)</em> コーヒーがほしいが</code> --</p><p><code>coffee is want-making (to me)</code> and then we&#39;ve added <code>が</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And what that <code>が</code> is doing is saying <code>but...</code> and it&#39;s implying a second clause but not stating it, so</p><p><code>コーヒーがほしいが</code> means something like &quot;I would like coffee, but...</p><p>if it&#39;s any trouble please don&#39;t try to get me any coffee&quot; or something along those lines.</p><h2 id="に-that-works-as-と" tabindex="-1">に that works as <code>と</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#に-that-works-as-と" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;に that works as &lt;code&gt;と&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The last one we&#39;re going to consider is less common, but if you&#39;re reading any amount of</p><p>Japanese you&#39;re going to come across it pretty soon, and that is <code>に</code>.</p><p>Now, we know <code>に</code>. It&#39;s again a logical particle.</p><p>It&#39;s the targeting particle, and I&#39;ve done a whole video on this because it&#39;s an important and complex particle.</p><p>But there is also another <code>に</code>.</p><p>And this other <code>に</code>, which is a slightly old usage -- it comes from older Japanese --</p><p>it means the same as <code>と</code>. It can be used to and-together two nouns or a list of nouns.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So in the folk tale Beauty and the Beast, when the father asks one of the less good sisters</p><p>what she would like him to bring back for her, she says <code>靴に指輪に帽子</code>.</p><p>She&#39;s saying she would like shoes and a ring and a hat.</p><p>So this <code>に</code> can be used to and-together two things or a list of things,</p><p>and it&#39;s completely different from the particle <code>に</code>.</p><p>It&#39;s a little bit literary, so you&#39;re more often going to see it in written Japanese.</p><p>But if you don&#39;t know that it&#39;s there, you can spend a long time puzzling over</p><p>what <code>に</code> means in these contexts.</p><p>It&#39;s also more commonly used in the expression <code>それに</code>, which means <code>furthermore</code> or <code>in addition to that</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>There is a typo in the picture’s orange note. それにとても should be それにしても.*<img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div><p>And, as you can see, this is made up of <code>それ</code>, which means <code>that</code>, plus <code>に</code> --</p><p>not the particle <code>に</code> but the <code>に</code> that means <code>and</code>.</p>',132),m=[u];function f(w,g,y,v,b,k){return t(),o("div",null,m)}const I=e(l,[["render",f]]);export{S as __pageData,I as default};
