Subjects in Japanese - and how to understand them | Lesson 66</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about the <code>hidden hand</code> in Japanese.</p><p>What do I mean by that?</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="no-subject-in-japanese" tabindex="-1">No subject in Japanese? <a class="header-anchor" href="#no-subject-in-japanese" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;No subject in Japanese?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Well, a number of people claim that Japanese has no subject.</p><p>And I think we&#39;ve established beyond any doubt that Japanese not only has a subject</p><p><em>(Lesson 9)</em> but that you can&#39;t have any Japanese sentence without a subject,</p><p>although you can&#39;t always see or hear the subject.</p><p>It can be a <code>zero-pronoun</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>By subject, of course, I mean the A-car of a sentence.</p><p>And since every sentence is telling us either that <code>A is B</code> or that <code>A does B</code>,</p><p>Obviously we can&#39;t have a sentence without A.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s as simple as that.</p><p>However, there are times when not only can&#39;t we see the subject, the A-car,</p><p>but it can be difficult to work out what exactly it is.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And this difficulty will be seen to derive from not fully</p><p>understanding how some aspects of Japanese work.</p><p>One thing we need to understand is that different languages have different expression-strategies.</p><h2 id="different-expression-strategies" tabindex="-1">Different expression strategies <a class="header-anchor" href="#different-expression-strategies" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Different expression strategies&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We know already how damaging it is to say that <code>コーヒーが好きだ</code> means <code>I like coffee</code>.</p><p><code>I like coffee</code> is what we would say in English,</p><p>but English uses an entirely different expression-strategy from Japanese.</p><p>Liking is expressed by a verb, and the doer of the verb is the person who likes the coffee.</p><p>In Japanese, liking is expressed by an adjectival noun,</p><p>and the be-er of that adjectival noun is the coffee.</p><p>So the Japanese expression-strategy here is closer to the Spanish than the English,</p><p>although they&#39;re not identical.</p><p>Now, although languages have differing expression-strategies,</p><p>it turns out that languages, even when they&#39;re not related,</p><p>tend to have a relatively limited bag of tricks that they draw on.</p><p>So we find the same expression-strategies in different languages,</p><p>but not necessarily in the same places.</p><p>And also expression-strategies can vary in status between languages.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="receptive-helper" tabindex="-1">Receptive helper <a class="header-anchor" href="#receptive-helper" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Receptive helper&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, one of the reasons that English so-called <code>Japanese grammar</code></p><p>misnames the Japanese receptive helper-verb as a passive conjugation or passive voice,</p><p>is that what it really is, while it exists in English, is not of very high status. <em>(Lesson 13)</em></p><p>Because we use the receptive in English by using the word <code>got</code> under various circumstances</p><p>like <code>I got rescued by my big sister</code>, <code>The sandwiches got eaten by the dog</code> --</p><p>but this isn&#39;t considered good English.</p><p>Now, the fact that it isn&#39;t considered good English is simply a matter of fashion.</p><p>It&#39;s perfectly grammatical.</p><p>It just happens to be unfashionable or to hold low status in the language.</p><p>This is really just a historical accident.</p><p>Now similarly, other expression-strategies exist in Japanese that are not considered</p><p>of very high status in English and that can confuse us.</p><p>So, I&#39;m going to take a sentence here which was put to me by one of my viewers,</p><p>who had considerable difficulty in disentangling what the subject of this sentence actually is.</p><p>And that&#39;s perfectly understandable, because until you understand this expression-strategy,</p><p>it&#39;s not entirely clear.</p><h2 id="hidden-subject-sentence-analysis" tabindex="-1">Hidden subject sentence analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#hidden-subject-sentence-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hidden subject sentence analysis&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, the sentence comes from NHK News Easy,</p><p>which is a very good news service for beginners in Japanese.</p><p>And the sentence is: <code>東京オリンピック選手が食べる料理をみんなに教えてもらう</code></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, what do we think is the subject, the A-car, of this sentence?</p><p>Now, the first thing to do when analyzing a sentence is what I said in my video on sentence analysis <em>(Lesson 37)</em>,</p><p>which is that we need to see where logical clauses end within a sentence.</p><p>A logical clause which is functioning as a logical clause and not a descriptor or a helper to anything else can only end in two ways,<br> either with a full stop, making it the end of a sentence,</p><p>or with a conjunction, marking it as the first logical clause within a compound sentence.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Of course, if it comes at the end of a sentence it may be followed by one or more sentence-ender particles,</p><p>but it has to be the final engine in the sentence: the final verb, noun-plus-copula or adjective.</p><p>So let&#39;s go through this in the manner that I&#39;ve taught you in the past.</p><p><code>東京オリンピック選手が食べる...</code></p><p>Is that a logical clause? Well, it could be a logical clause, couldn&#39;t it?</p><p>It would mean <code>The Tokyo Olympic athletes eat.</code></p><p>However, is it followed by a full stop, by sentence-ender particles with a full stop,</p><p>or does it end in some kind of a clause connector like <code>から</code> or <code>でも</code> or the て-form</p><p>or the い-stem of a verb?</p><p>No, it doesn&#39;t end with any of those, does it?</p><p>It&#39;s directly followed by a noun.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And, as we know, when a logical clause is directly followed by a noun,</p><p>what it&#39;s doing is modifying that noun.</p><p>In other words, it&#39;s not functioning as an active logical clause;</p><p>it&#39;s functioning as, essentially, an adjective, a noun modifier.</p><p>So <code>東京オリンピック選手が食べる</code> is all simply modifying <code>料理</code>.</p><p>It&#39;s just telling us more about the food.</p><p>So then we have: <code>...料理をみんなに教えてもらう</code></p><p>Now, we still haven&#39;t arrived at the subject of the sentence, have we?</p><p>Because the subject of any sentence has to be marked with が.</p><p>The <code>選手</code> are marked with が, but we know they&#39;re not the subject of the sentence;</p><p>they&#39;re just helping to modify <code>料理</code>.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Just put this here…the link is for Lesson 47. Check also Lesson 46.</p></div><p><code>料理</code> can&#39;t be the subject of the sentence because it&#39;s marked with を, not が.</p><p><code>みんな</code> can&#39;t be the subject of the sentence because it&#39;s marked with に, not が.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what is going on here?</p><h2 id="hidden-subject-sentence-action" tabindex="-1">Hidden subject sentence action <a class="header-anchor" href="#hidden-subject-sentence-action" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Hidden subject sentence action&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Well, what is the sentence actually saying?</p><p>It&#39;s saying that someone, the subject of the sentence,</p><p>whoever that may be, is having everyone teach or advise</p><p>them about the food the Olympic athletes are to eat.</p><p>Now, my questioner actually got this far,</p><p>but then was stumped by the question of who this unnamed person or people might be.</p><p>Could it be the athletes?</p><p>Well, that isn&#39;t likely, and we always have to consider likelihood in resolving any kind of ambiguity. <em>(Lesson 48)</em></p><p>This isn&#39;t really an ambiguous sentence</p><p>but the context makes it pretty clear that it&#39;s not the athletes.</p><p>First of all, by default these <code>-てもらう</code> sentences mean that</p><p>somebody actively had someone else do something. <em>(Lesson 49)</em></p><p>So the person doing <code>もらう</code> <em>(the A zeroが subject)</em> is getting <em>(the B train - もらう)</em> the person <em>(みんなに)</em> doing the て-formed verb to do that て-formed verb <em>(教えて)</em>.</p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So if we say <code>お医者さんに見てもらう</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>have the doctor look at me</code>.</p><p>So someone is having everybody teach them or give their opinions on what the athletes should eat.</p><p>Is this likely to be the athletes? Well, not really.</p><p>Are they likely to be getting together and asking everybody what they should eat?</p><h3 id="who-is-the-subject-here" tabindex="-1">Who is the subject here? <a class="header-anchor" href="#who-is-the-subject-here" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Who is the subject here?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>So who is it?</p><p>Who is the が-marked zero-pronoun, the subject, the A-car of this sentence?</p><p>And the answer is, it is simply an undefined zero-pronoun.</p><p>Now, that might seem very strange, but in fact it isn&#39;t.</p><p>As a matter of fact, we use it all the time in English.</p><p>But you would never see it in a newspaper or a news service the way it is here,</p><p>which is what&#39;s confusing about it.</p><p>So when do we use an undefined pronoun like this?</p><p>Well, let&#39;s think about it.</p><p>Suppose someone said <code>I hear they&#39;re putting a man on Mars next year.</code></p><p>Well, who&#39;s <code>they</code>?</p><p>Well, we don&#39;t know who <code>they</code> is.</p><p>Presumably whoever it is that puts men on Mars -- NASA or Mr. Musk, or somebody.</p><p>Now, suppose I say</p><p><code>They&#39;re getting everyone&#39;s opinion on what the Olympic athletes should eat.</code></p><p>Well again, somebody might well say that in English.</p><p>You wouldn&#39;t see it in the newspaper, but a friend might well say it to you:</p><p><code>You know, they&#39;re getting everybody&#39;s opinion on what the Olympic athletes should eat.</code></p><p>Who&#39;s <code>they</code>? Well, we don&#39;t really know.</p><p>Whoever it is that&#39;s responsible for feeding the Olympic athletes, presumably.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And this is a construction that you&#39;ll see quite often in Japanese,</p><p>this unnamed <code>they</code>, whoever they might be.</p><p>You hear it in English all the time but it&#39;s of low status.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>You won&#39;t see it in official documents or newspapers or anything like that.</p><p>You only hear it in relatively casual speech.</p><p>In French you might hear it more often.</p><p><code>On</code> (they, one) can be used more generically at a higher level of discourse than it can in English.</p><p>So once we know this, it&#39;s easy enough to pinpoint the subject of this sentence.</p><p>And it&#39;s an important thing to know because we&#39;re going to come across this kind of construction</p><p>relatively often in Japanese.</p>',151)]))}const z=t(v,[["render",j]]);export{S as __pageData,z as default};
