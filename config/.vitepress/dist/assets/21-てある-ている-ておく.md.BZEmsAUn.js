What they never teach!</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today, we&#39;re going to go back to Alice&#39;s adventures, and we&#39;re going to use them as an opportunity to look into some of the deeper and more subtle uses of the て-form.</p><p>These are covered in the regular textbooks and Japanese learning websites, but as usual</p><p>they don&#39;t explain the logic behind them, which makes them more difficult to grasp.</p><p>And in some cases where there isn&#39;t a straightforward English equivalent they really don&#39;t tell</p><p>you what&#39;s actually going on, because they only talk in terms of English equivalents,</p><p>which leaves you guessing quite a bit of the time.</p><p>So, if you remember, Alice was falling very slowly down the rabbit hole and she had taken a jar off one of the shelves as she fell.</p><p><code>そのびんにはラベルが貼ってあって 「オレンジ・マーマレード」と書いてあった</code></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we have three て-formed verbs in this sentence.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at what they&#39;re doing.</p><p><code>そのびんにはラベルが貼<strong>ってあって</strong>.</code></p><p><code>びん/瓶</code> is the word being used for a <code>jar</code> here.</p><p>It can mean <code>bottle</code> – it&#39;s often translated as <code>bottle</code> – but it can also mean a <code>jar</code></p><p>and that&#39;s what it means here.</p><p><code>ラベル</code> means <code>label</code>.</p><p>It&#39;s <code>ラベル</code> and not <code>レベル</code>, I believe, because it comes from another European language other than English.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>レベル means <code>level</code>.</p></div><p>We can also say <code>レーベル</code>, but that&#39;s less common than <code>ラベル</code>. <em>(The ー is important here)</em></p><p><code>貼る</code> means <code>stick</code> or <code>paste</code> something onto something else,</p><p>so this means that a label was pasted onto the bottle.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Literally, <strong>speaking of that bottle as the target of something</strong>, a label was pasted onto it.</p><p>Now this use, <code>貼ってある</code>, we haven&#39;t covered in this course up to now.</p><p>We&#39;ve talked about て-form of a verb plus <code>いる</code>, and we know that <code>いる</code> means <code>be</code> and</p><p>て-form of a verb plus <code>いる</code> means to be-doing that verb or to be-in-a-state of that verb.</p><h2 id="てある" tabindex="-1">てある <a class="header-anchor" href="#てある" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;てある&quot;">​</a></h2><p>What about <code>-てある</code>?</p><p><code>ある</code> also means <code>be</code>, so the meaning is in fact very similar.</p><p><strong>It also means to be-in-a-state of that verb.</strong></p><p>However, there is a difference, and I&#39;m going to explain that difference with another example.</p><p>Let&#39;s take the sentence <code>窓が開い<strong>ている</strong></code> and the sentence <code>窓が開け<strong>てある</strong></code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Both of them mean <code>The window is open</code>.</p><p><code>開い<strong>ている</strong></code> simply means that the window is open, and we can translate that directly into</p><p>English, and it&#39;s really the same thing.</p><p><strong>But <code>窓が開けてある</code> doesn&#39;t have any English equivalent</strong></p><p><strong>because it still means the window is open but it carries another implication.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>First of all, we are using the other-move version of <code>開く</code>, which is <code>開ける</code> <em>(bottom one)</em>.</p><p><code>窓が<strong>開いている</strong></code> – <strong>that&#39;s the self-move version of <code>開く</code></strong></p><p>and it simply means <strong>to be open, to exist in a state of openness.</strong></p><p>The other-move verb, <code><strong>開ける</strong></code>, which is the regular く / ける う-ending verb to え-stem + -る</p><p>of the third law of self-move/other-move verbs that we&#39;ve looked at already. <em>(Lesson 15)</em></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>So <code>開く</code> <em>(the one up)</em> means be open yourself, whatever you are, a box or whatever;</strong></p><p><strong><code>開ける</code> <em>(the one down)</em> means open the box, open the door etc.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what <strong><code>窓が開けてある</code> means is that the window was open,</strong></p><p><strong>but it was open because somebody else opened it.</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re signalling that in the first place by using the other-move version of the verb and</strong></p><p><strong>in the second place by using <code>ある</code> instead of <code>いる</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what&#39;s the reasoning behind that?</p><p>Well, when we say <code>窓が開い<strong>ている</strong></code>, <strong>although it is an inanimate object, we&#39;re using the</strong></p><p><strong>version of <code>be</code> which we use for animate beings, people and animals and such.</strong></p><p>That in fact is the part that needs explaining, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>Why are we using the animate version of <code>be</code> for an inanimate object like a window?</p><p>And we do this all the time.</p><p><strong>We&#39;re always saying <code>-ている</code> for inanimate objects of all kinds.</strong></p><p>The reason is that <strong>in this expression we&#39;re simply saying the window was open –</strong></p><p><strong>we&#39;re not implying that anybody opened the window.</strong></p><p>So, in a way, <strong>we can say that we&#39;re treating the window as an honorary animate being.</strong></p><p><strong>The window was open, as it were, of its own volition.</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re not saying it&#39;s open because of anybody&#39;s will other than its own.</strong></p><p>So in a certain sense we are treating the window as an honorary animate being:</p><p><code>窓が開いている</code>.</p><hr><p>But if we say <code>窓が開け<strong>てある</strong></code>, <strong>we are saying that somebody opened the window.</strong></p><p><strong>The window was the mere object of having been opened by somebody else.</strong></p><p><strong>So it loses its status as an honorary animate being.</strong></p><p><strong>It is treated as a mere object, an inanimate thing</strong> – <code>開け<strong>てある</strong></code>.</p><hr><p>And the thing to understand here is that <strong>even though it&#39;s lost its status as an animate being,</strong></p><p><strong>even though we&#39;re using the other-move version of the verb,</strong></p><p><strong>the が-marked actor of this sentence is the window:</strong></p><p><code><strong>窓が</strong>開けてある</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>The window is doing the action, which is <code>ある</code>: the window is existing in a state of having been opened by somebody else.</strong></p><hr><p>And that is the same thing that&#39;s happening in our sentence from Alice.</p><p><code>そのびんには<strong>ラベルが貼ってあって</strong></code> –</p><p><code>The jar <strong>existed in a state of</strong> having had <strong>a label</strong> <strong>pasted</strong> (onto it) <em>and…</em></code></p><p>Now, as you see, there is really nothing equivalent to this in English, so we just need to get</p><p>it into our minds so that we can look at the Japanese as Japanese.</p><p>This is fundamental to what I&#39;m teaching here.</p><p>I&#39;m teaching the real structure of Japanese, not simply throwing some Japanese at you and</p><p>throwing some English at you and saying, <code>Well, this kind of means that.</code></p><p>We need to get rid of English translation as far as possible and look at the Japanese</p><p>as it really works in itself as Japanese.</p><p>And that&#39;s why my <code>translations</code> under the trains get weirder and weirder.</p><p>Because I&#39;m not trying to translate this for you into natural English.</p><p>I&#39;m trying to tell you what the Japanese is really doing.</p><p>So the second half of the sentence...</p><p><strong>The second て-form</strong> <em>(あって)</em>, of course, <strong>is simply joining the first logical clause in this compound sentence to the second logical clause</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And the second logical clause is</p><p><code>「オレンジ・マーマレード」と書い<strong>てあった</strong></code>.</p><p>And here we have again this <code>-てある</code> form.</p><p>And whenever we talk about something being written on something we tend to use this form.</p><p>We don&#39;t say &quot;The label said &#39;Orange Marmalade****&#39;, which is what we say in English,</p><p>as if the label could speak. We say</p><p><code>「オレンジ・マーマレード」と<strong>書いてあった</strong></code>.</p><p>-と is our quotation particle, of course, that&#39;s quoting exactly what was written on the label,</p><p>and then <code><strong>書いてある</strong></code> means that it was</p><p><strong>in a state of having had those words written on it by somebody else.</strong></p><p>Now, I&#39;m going to do something a tiny bit unusual here. I hope you won&#39;t mind.</p><p>I&#39;m going to skip ahead just a little bit in the story, because the next part contains</p><p>a very interesting point that really needs a lesson of its own, and the part immediately</p><p>after that includes something that really rounds out what we&#39;re doing today.</p><h2 id="ておく" tabindex="-1">ておく <a class="header-anchor" href="#ておく" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ておく&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It introduces <code>-ておく</code>, which really belongs together with <code>-ている</code> and <code>-てある</code>.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>This relationship is something the textbooks don&#39;t explain and because they don&#39;t it leaves</p><p><code>-ておく</code> rather undefined in people&#39;s minds.</p><p>Many quite advanced students don&#39;t really understand why <code>-ておく</code> is used in some cases.</p><p>So we&#39;ll go ahead with that now and I&#39;ll just fill you in on the story in between.</p><p>It&#39;s only a little bit.</p><p>Alice realizes that the marmalade jar is in fact empty, and what&#39;s she going to do with it?</p><p>She doesn&#39;t want to drop it because it&#39;ll fall all the way down the hole and very likely kill someone.</p><p>And, if you read the newspapers, you&#39;re probably aware that there are far too many</p><p>empty marmalade jar incidents in Wonderland already.</p><p>So, now you know the background, let&#39;s carry on.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>うまくとだなの一つへ通りすがりに<strong>置いておいた</strong></code></p><p><code>うまく</code> means <code>skilfully</code>; <code>とだな/戸棚</code> as we know is a <code>cupboard</code>;</p><p><code>とだなの一つ</code>, as we talked about in the last lesson <em>(Lesson ??)</em>, is <code>one of the cupboards</code>.</p><p>So she skilfully in passing put it into one of the cupboards.</p><p>And what&#39;s this <code><strong>置いておいた</strong></code>?</p><p>Now, <strong>they&#39;re both the same <code>置く</code></strong>, <code>置く</code> meaning to <code>put</code>.</p><p>The first one is simple enough: she <code>put</code> it into the cupboard,</p><p>but why do we have the second <code>おく</code> at the end of it – <code>置いて<strong>おいた</strong></code>?</p><p>Now, this is another very common and very important て-form usage and it&#39;s one that</p><p>the textbooks and English-language websites tend not to explain very well,</p><p>because it&#39;s something we really don&#39;t have in English.</p><p>However, we already halfway know it,<br> because <strong>it is in a certain sense the other half of <code>-てある</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><code>-ておく</code> means to put the action in place.</strong></p><p>Now in this particular use, it&#39;s quite easy to see because she&#39;s putting the jar literally</p><p>into place and she&#39;s putting that action into place.</p><p>What the textbooks and websites tell you is that it means doing something in advance,</p><p>doing something for the purpose of something else. And this is true in many cases.</p><p>It&#39;s probably the nearest you can get in English.<br> But <strong>what it actually means is putting the action in place.</strong></p><p>And to understand this let&#39;s go back to our example</p><p><code>窓が開けてある</code> – <code>the window is open because somebody opened it</code>.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><hr><p>Now, the somebody who opened it, if we say it instead of from the point of view of the window, from the point of view of the person doing the action, 👇</p><p><code><strong>開けておく</strong></code> is the other side of this.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>The person put the opening of the window into place so that thereafter the window would be open.</strong></p><p>So you see we have the two halves of the same coin.</p><p><code><strong>窓が</strong>開け<strong>てある</strong></code> – <strong>the window stands open because somebody put it there.</strong></p><p><code><strong>窓を</strong>開け<strong>ておく</strong></code> – <strong>open a window so that it will stand open for the future, so that</strong></p><p><strong>it will then be open, put into place the action of opening the window.</strong></p><p>And this is what <code>おく</code> means – <code>おく</code> means <code>place</code>.</p><hr><p><strong>So you&#39;re <code>placing</code> the action, you&#39;re putting it into place, you&#39;re setting it up.</strong></p><p>And <strong>that&#39;s why it tends to have the secondary meaning of <code>do in advance</code> or <code>do for another purpose</code>, because you are setting up that action and the implication is that you want the effect of that action to <code>remain in place</code> for whatever future purposes it may have.</strong></p><hr><p>In this case, Alice does not have a future purpose.</p><p><strong>So in fact, て-form plus <code>おく</code> has a much wider range of meaning than</strong></p><p><strong>the <code>do in advance</code> or <code>do for a purpose</code></strong> kind of English translation that it gets in the textbooks.</p><hr><p><strong>In the case of Alice in this story, she isn&#39;t really doing anything in advance or for a purpose; she&#39;s simply trying to solve the problem of what to do with the empty marmalade jar without risking injuring the people below.</strong></p><p>And there are many cases when this usage falls even further from the English-language definitions.</p><p>For example, people say, <code>It&#39;s cruel to lock <em>(up)</em> a small child in her room</code>,</p><p>and for this we use</p><p><code>閉じ込め<strong>ておく</strong></code>.</p><p><code>閉じ込める</code> is <code>shut someone up/lock someone away</code></p><p>and <strong>the <code>-ておく</code> here doesn&#39;t mean do it for a purpose, it doesn&#39;t mean do it in advance.</strong></p><p><strong>It means do the action and leave its results in place/put the action in place and leave it in effect.</strong></p><p>Similarly, people say, <code>It&#39;s all right to leave a baby to cry sometimes</code> – <code>泣かせ<strong>ておく</strong></code>.</p><p><code>泣く</code> is <code>cry</code>; <code>泣かせる</code> is the causative of cry: <code>allow to cry</code> in this case. <em>(<strong>Lesson 19</strong>)</em></p><p>And <strong>the <code>-ておく</code></strong> doesn&#39;t mean do it in advance or do it for some special purpose.</p><p>It <strong>simply means do the action and leave its effects in place/put the action in place.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This can be a bit tricky (judging also by the sheer amount of concentrated underlining, (btw. let me know if it is hard to read), so I recommend also checking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYrqFjPvwSI&amp;list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj&amp;index=27&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the comments</a>, as usual.</p></div>',180),v=[b];function _(k,x,A,I,S,j){return t(),o("div",null,v)}const E=e(f,[["render",_]]);export{q as __pageData,E as default};
