How it really works.</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about an expression that you see all the time in anime, manga,</p><p>light novels etcetera, and can be confusing for two reasons.</p><p>One is that the apparent etymology,</p><p>the apparent base of the word is very obvious but it&#39;s completely misleading.</p><p>And the other is that because of the way it&#39;s used,</p><p>it&#39;s often a bit unclear about which way it&#39;s pointing</p><p>and what it&#39;s actually doing.</p><p>However, once we get clear about this, it&#39;s very, very easy to understand.</p><p><strong>The expression is <code>くせに</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, the etymological problem is that</p><p>whereas we all know what <code>くせ / 癖</code> means</p><p><strong>-- it means a <code>habit or idiosyncrasy</code> --</strong></p><p><strong>but it&#39;s not very clear what that has to do with the expression <code>くせに</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>And the answer is: nothing.</strong></p><p><strong>Some Japanese etymological sources tell us that</strong></p><p><strong>this <code>くせ</code> was actually a different <code>くせ</code> originally,</strong></p><p><strong>but nobody really seems to know for sure.</strong></p><p><strong>But the point is that it really</strong></p><p><strong>has very little to do with the modern usage.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>All we really need to know is that <code>くせに</code></strong></p><p><strong>is a contrastive conjunction like <code>のに</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au5JOtcwE7A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>I&#39;ve done a video</strong></a> about <code>のに</code> and I&#39;ll put a link here,</p><p>but I&#39;m going to assume that you basically know what it is and what it does.</p><p><strong><code>のに</code> and <code>くせに</code> are contrastive conjunctions, which means</strong></p><p><strong>that they&#39;re like <code>でも</code> or <code>けれど</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>They join two clauses in a manner that means</strong></p><p><strong><code>despite Clause A, Clause B / even though Clause A, Clause B</code>.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Now, <code>くせに</code> has two things in common with <code>のに</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>One is that it&#39;s generally negative in its implications,</strong></p><p><strong>and the other is that the second clause quite often gets omitted.</strong></p><p><strong>So we&#39;re saying, <code>although Clause A...</code></strong></p><p><strong>and then not going on to say what clause B is.</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re just implying it.</strong></p><p><strong><code>のに</code> does that quite often and so does <code>くせに</code>.</strong></p><h2 id="the-difference-between-のに-and-くせに" tabindex="-1">The difference between のに and くせに <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-difference-between-のに-and-くせに" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The difference between のに and くせに&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>The difference between <code>のに</code> and <code>くせに</code> is that<br><code>くせに</code> not only has a negative implication</strong></p><p><strong>but it has most of the time a very specific kind of negative implication.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And this special usage is essentially</strong></p><p><strong>taking the nature or character or position of a person</strong></p><p><strong>and then contrasting their actions with it in a way</strong></p><p><strong>that is highly unfavorable,</strong></p><p><strong>so we could use <code>のに</code> in these situations,</strong></p><p><strong>but <code>のに</code> would sound more regretful.</strong></p><p><strong><code>くせに</code> sounds much more forceful.</strong></p><p><strong>It often sounds like severe criticism.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And, as we say, it&#39;s making this kind of contrast,</strong></p><p><strong>the contrast between what we expect of a certain type</strong></p><p><strong>and what they actually do, and it&#39;s a negative contrast.</strong></p><hr><p>So, for example, we might say, <code>お金持ちの<strong>くせに</strong>ケチだ</code></p><p>(<strong>despite the fact that</strong> she&#39;s well off / she&#39;s rich, she&#39;s stingy).</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>女の<strong>くせに</strong>部屋が目茶苦茶だ</code></p><p>(<strong>despite the fact that</strong> she&#39;s a girl, her room&#39;s a mess).</p><p><code>男の<strong>くせに</strong>泣いている</code></p><p>(<strong>despite the fact that</strong> he&#39;s a man, he&#39;s crying).</p><p><strong>And these are generally intended in an offensive manner.</strong></p><p><strong>They&#39;re intended to register harsh criticism.</strong></p><p><strong>So we&#39;re taking the position of the person</strong></p><p><strong>and what we expect of that kind of person</strong></p><p><strong>and then saying something that&#39;s in contrast to it.</strong></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>But very often we also leave that out.</strong></p><p>So, for example, suppose some bad people or monsters break into the house</p><p>and the heroine confronts them and the hero is cowering in a corner.</p><p>The heroine might just say, <code>男の<strong>くせに</strong></code>, which literally means</p><p><code><strong>Despite the fact that</strong> you&#39;re a man</code></p><p><strong>but doesn&#39;t then say anything about it.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In English probably a non-structural but natural translation would be</p><p><code>And you&#39;re supposed to be a man</code>.</p><hr><p><strong>And this can cause confusion because</strong></p><p><strong>it can lead to constructions that confuse us about what&#39;s really going on</strong></p><p><strong>and which way <code>くせに</code> is pointing.</strong></p><hr><p>So, for example, <code>男の<strong>くせに</strong>泣かないでよ</code>.</p><p>Now what&#39;s going on here?</p><p><code><strong>Despite the fact that</strong> you&#39;re a man, stop crying</code>?</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Is that what it&#39;s saying? Well, no, it isn&#39;t.</strong></p><p><code>男の<strong>くせに</strong></code> <strong>is being used in a trailing manner like the previous example.</strong></p><p><strong>And then <code>泣かないでよ</code> is being added to that trailing insult,</strong></p><p><strong>as it were, and that&#39;s a command.</strong></p><p>I&#39;ve done a video on commands. <em>(Lesson 83)</em></p><p><strong>So, <code>泣かないでよ</code> is not a sentence, it&#39;s just a command: <code>Stop crying!</code></strong></p><p>Just as in English <code>Stop crying</code> is not a sentence with a subject and a predicate.</p><p>It&#39;s just a command.</p><p><strong>So really those two statements</strong></p><p><strong>should be separated by a period (or in Japanese a <code>まる / 。</code>)</strong></p><p><strong>because they&#39;re not part of the same sentence,</strong></p><p>but they won&#39;t necessarily be when you see them written</p><p>and they won&#39;t necessarily have a wide gap when you hear them spoken.</p><p><code>男のくせに泣かないでよ</code>:</p><p><strong>these are two separate statements</strong></p><p>and if we don&#39;t understand that</p><p>it can confuse us about the use of <code>くせに</code>.</p><hr><p>Another thing that can be confusing is that</p><p><strong>the connection may go the other way around.</strong></p><p>Generally speaking, <strong>we take the qualities of a person,</strong></p><p><strong>which are fundamentally good qualities</strong></p><p>-- being a man, being a girl, being rich --</p><p><strong>and then adding something negative to it:</strong></p><p><strong>Despite the fact that</strong> you&#39;re a girl, the room&#39;s a mess /</p><p><strong>Despite the fact that</strong> you&#39;re a man, you&#39;re hiding in the corner /</p><p><strong>Despite the fact that</strong> you&#39;re rich, you&#39;re stingy.</p><hr><p><strong>But it can go the other way around too.</strong></p><p>For example, we might say</p><p><code>下手な<strong>くせに</strong>熱心だ</code>.</p><p>This means <code><strong>despite the fact that</strong> he&#39;s unskilful / useless, he&#39;s enthusiastic</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Now, this generally isn&#39;t used in a positive sense.</strong></p><p>It&#39;s meaning:<br> &quot;Here&#39;s this person going around being all enthusiastic, and he&#39;s useless, he can&#39;t do anything’.</p><hr><p><strong>So it can also work that way around and we need to be aware of that,</strong></p><p>because that again can fool us.</p><p><strong>Most of the time the contrastive conjunction</strong></p><p><strong>goes the way around we&#39;ve been talking about,</strong></p><p><strong>but it doesn&#39;t have to.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, if this was a textbook or a JLPT instruction</p><p>we would talk about what they call the <code>接続</code> (the conjunctions):</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>接続 is an abbreviation that can be used for the term conjunction, full version is 接続語</p></div><p>how does <code>くせに</code> attach to what comes before it?</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>We know how it attaches to what comes after it:</strong></p><p><strong>it&#39;s simply a clause connector</strong></p><p><strong>so what comes after it is the second clause, which could be left off.</strong></p><p>But what the standard texts will talk about is how it connects to what comes before it:</p><p>with a noun you use の,</p><p>with an adjectival noun you use -な,</p><p>with an adjective you don&#39;t use anything.</p><p><strong>None of this, of course, is necessary if you&#39;ve done structural Japanese.</strong></p><hr><p><strong><code>くせ</code>, whatever it is, whatever its etymology, is a noun.</strong></p><p><strong>We pretty much know that, because</strong></p><p><strong>anything that isn&#39;t a verb or an adjective is a noun in Japanese.</strong></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>What comes before <code>くせ</code> is modifying <code>くせ</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>it&#39;s telling us what kind of <code>くせ</code> we&#39;re talking about.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And it does that in exactly the same way that every modifier always modifies a noun.</strong></p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>So, if it&#39;s a noun, which it most often is,</strong></p><p><strong>then we use の for modifying the other noun</strong></p><p>that&#39;s following it just as we always do:</p><p><code>男<strong>の</strong>くせ / 女<strong>の</strong>くせに</code>.</p><p><strong>If it happens to be an adjectival noun,</strong></p><p><strong>then obviously we use -な</strong> as we did with <code>下手<strong>な</strong>くせに</code>.</p><p><strong>And if it&#39;s an adjective obviously we don&#39;t need anything else</strong></p><p>-- <strong>adjectives modify nouns directly.</strong></p><p>That&#39;s what an adjective does.</p><hr><p>So we might say <code><strong>若い</strong>くせにお年寄りに席を譲らない</code></p><p>(even though she**&#39;s young**, she doesn&#39;t give up her seat to older people).</p><p><strong>If it were a verb, obviously we&#39;d just use the verb to modify the noun as we always do.</strong></p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So I think now that you won&#39;t have any problems with <code>くせに</code>.</p><hr><p>If you have any problems or questions, about that or anything else,</p><p>please put them in the Comments below and I will answer as usual.</p><p>I&#39;d like to thank my Gold Kokeshi patrons, my producer-angels,</p><p>who make these videos possible, and all my patrons and supporters.</p><p>One of the things that our revolution in Japanese is doing is</p><p>not just showing us techniques to apply but showing us that we need to apply them flexibly.</p><p>Some techniques apply sometimes and not other times.</p><p>History and etymology of words can be very useful on occasion,</p><p>and I&#39;ve done videos about that.</p><p>And whenever I do a video about that,</p><p>even if I point out that history and etymology are not always very useful,</p><p>people start asking me,</p><p><code>Do you know the history of this, do you know the history of that?</code></p><p>And well, of course I can just look it up in most cases.</p><p>You can&#39;t always find it in English</p><p>but you can usually find it in Japanese.</p><p><strong>But the point is that there are occasions</strong></p><p><strong>where the etymology helps us enormously,</strong></p><p><strong>there are occasions where it doesn&#39;t help us at all,</strong></p><p><strong>there are occasions where it could help us somewhat</strong></p><p><strong>but it&#39;s a rather roundabout route</strong></p><p><strong>and we can shortcut it by learning things by another method.</strong></p><p><strong>Part of our revolution here</strong></p><p><strong>is getting away from the rigid approach of textbooks.</strong></p><p><strong>But always applying the fundamental structural knowledge,</strong></p><p><strong>because structural knowledge gives us the core we need</strong></p><p><strong>to get us away from rote learning of this and rote learning of that.</strong></p><p>Thank you all for your help in this revolution.</p>',198),b=[f];function v(_,k,I,A,j,x){return o(),e("div",null,b)}const C=t(y,[["render",v]]);export{B as __pageData,C as
