How they REALLY work.</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは.</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to get the key to every Japanese sentence.</p><p>We&#39;re going to do a round-up of the logical particles – and <strong>the logical particles are the linchpins of Japanese.</strong></p><p>With a full understanding of what they do you can understand every Japanese sentence.</p><p>Without it, you can&#39;t.</p><p>And that&#39;s why the Japanese taught by the textbook which doesn&#39;t explain the logical particles correctly leaves most learners non-functional in Japanese even after they&#39;ve passed exams.</p><p>So, I&#39;m going to do a round-up of the logical particles we&#39;ve learned so far and I&#39;m going</p><p>to introduce the last major logical particle, which is the で-particle.</p><p>I&#39;m going to do this with an analogy of detective work, <strong>because the logical particles essentially interrogate the nouns in the sentence and show how they relate to each other</strong></p><p><strong>and to the verb of the sentence, and they give the structure of the sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And this is what a logical particle is.</p><p>People sometimes ask <code>What do you mean by a logical particle?</code></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We&#39;ve already discussed the difference between a logical particle and a non-logical topic-marker.</p><p><strong>A logical particle tells us how the sentence logically holds together.</strong></p><p><strong>It tells us who does what to whom, with what, where, when and so forth.</strong></p><p><strong>The は-particle doesn&#39;t do this, it just tells us what is the topic we&#39;re speaking about.</strong></p><hr><p>There are other particles that I would call a-logical.</p><p>They&#39;re not non-logical topic markers, but they&#39;re not logical particles either.</p><p>For example, <strong>the particle -と adds two nouns together.</strong></p><p>So if we say <code>さくらとメアリーがあるいていた</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>Sakura and Mary were walking</code>.</p><p><strong>The が-particle tells us who was doing the walking.</strong></p><p><strong>The と-particle simply adds those two together. It doesn&#39;t tell us anything about what they were doing, where they were going, or anything else.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, <strong>the logical particles are the ones that tell us what is actually happening in the sentence.</strong></p><p>The other thing to remember about logical particles is that <strong>they always attach to a noun.</strong></p><p>If you see a logical particle attaching to anything, you know that that word is in fact functionally a noun.</p><p>And <strong>we must always see the noun plus the particle attaching to it as an inseparable pair.</strong></p><p>The two work together.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>They are a question and an answer which form a fundamental unit of a Japanese sentence.</p><p>All right. So let&#39;s look at this.</p><h2 id="particle-が" tabindex="-1">Particle が <a class="header-anchor" href="#particle-が" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Particle が&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The head of the Logical Particle Detective Agency is Detective が.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>He is the Chief.</p><p><strong>He has to be in every case.</strong></p><p><strong>There can&#39;t be a sentence without が</strong>, as we already know, <strong>although sometimes you can&#39;t see him</strong> because he&#39;s in disguise, just like Sherlock Holmes is sometimes in disguise.</p><p>He also has powers that the other logical particles do not have.</p><p><strong>He can work in A-is-B sentences, that is, descriptive sentences,</strong></p><p><strong>sentences that tell us what something is, what its qualities are.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>The other particles can&#39;t do that.</strong></p><p>They can only work in A-does-B sentences, that is, sentences with a verb engine.</p><p>To put it another way, while Detective Ga works in the office with descriptive work,</p><p>the other detectives only work on cases, on actual actions, on incidents, on verb-ending clauses.</p><p>So, let&#39;s look at them all at work on a verb-ending clause.</p><p>Each of them has its own specific questions.</p><p>Detective が asks the fundamental question: <code>Who did it?</code></p><p>This is the fundamental question of any sentence,</p><p>and for that reason, only Detective が&#39;s carriage can be black.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Because <strong>the core of every sentence is <code>who did the action?</code></strong></p><p>So が asks, <code>Who was the actor? Who dunnit?</code> and that forms the core of the sentence.</p><p>The other logical particles ask other questions about the incident which give us</p><p>a complete picture of the event.</p><p>We won&#39;t usually see all of them in any one sentence.</p><h2 id="particles-を-に-へ" tabindex="-1">Particles を, に, へ <a class="header-anchor" href="#particles-を-に-へ" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Particles を, に, へ&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Detective を asks <code>Who was it done to? Who was the receiver of the action?</code></strong></p><p><strong>Detective に asks <code>Where did he go?</code> or <code>Where is the weapon?</code></strong></p><p>に asks where someone or something went to or where it is.</p><p><strong>Detective へ asks <code>In what direction did he go?</code></strong></p><p>Now, this is very close to Detective に&#39;s question, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>But we may not actually know where he went, so the answer to that question could be north, south, east or west, <strong>and that&#39;s the kind of question that に can&#39;t ask.</strong></p><p>Or it could be <code>He went in the direction of Sakura&#39;s house</code>, and that&#39;s very close</p><p>to the question that に does ask.</p><p>So they overlap to quite a degree.</p><h2 id="particle-で" tabindex="-1">Particle で <a class="header-anchor" href="#particle-で" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Particle で&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now let&#39;s look at Detective で.</p><p><strong>Detective で asks the question <code>Where was it done?</code></strong></p><p><strong>and the question <code>With what was it done? What was the weapon?</code></strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If we say <code>(zeroが)こうえんにいる</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>(I) am in the park</code>.</p><p>But if we want to say <code>(I) am <em>playing</em> <strong>in</strong> the park</code>, we have to say<br><code>(zeroが)こうえん<strong>で</strong><em>あそんで</em>いる</code>,</p><p>because <strong>to express that we are doing something in a place rather than just being there, we have to use で.</strong></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And <strong>we also use で to express the means (in terms of a noun) by which we do something.</strong></p><p>So if we say <code>(zeroが)こえうんにいく</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>(I) go to the park</code>.</p><p>But if we say <code>(zeroが)バス<strong>で</strong>こうえんにいく</code>, <strong>we&#39;re saying the means by which we go to the park, in this case a bus.</strong></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If we say that we knocked in a hammer with a nail or ate food with chopsticks,</p><p><strong>we use で for the thing we did it with.</strong></p><p>If we say <code>(zeroが)にほんごをはなす</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>(I) speak Japanese</code>,<br> but if we say <code>(zeroが)にほんご<strong>で</strong>はなす</code>, we&#39;re saying</p><p><code>(I) speak with Japanese <strong>Japanese is the means by which</strong> (I) speak</code>.</p><p>So this is equivalent in English to saying <code>I speak in Japanese</code>, but as you can see,</p><p>the Japanese construction is more logical because that actually is what we&#39;re doing,</p><p><strong>we&#39;re speaking by the means of Japanese.</strong></p><hr><p>The other question, of course, that <strong>Detective に</strong> can ask is<br><code>Who was the target of an action done to something else?</code><br><em>but we&#39;ve already discussed that in the に lesson. (Lesson 8)</em></p><p>So this covers all the basic functions of the main logical particles, and as you can see,</p><p>these are the particles that tell us what&#39;s going on in any Japanese sentence.</p><p>If we understand them, we can understand the sentence; if we don&#39;t understand them, we can&#39;t.</p><p>So if we get confused by the logical particles, which we will if we take the textbooks seriously, we&#39;ll have a lot of trouble understanding Japanese.</p><p><strong>Don&#39;t confuse the particles and they won&#39;t confuse you.</strong></p>',98),u=[w];function m(y,f,b,k,_,v){return a(),t("div",null,u)}const I=e(d,[["render",m]]);export{x as __pageData,I as default};
