and going in Japanese.</p><p>Now, <code>行く</code> and <code>来る</code> are two of the first words we learn when we start learning Japanese,</p><p>and we learn that they mean <code>come</code> and <code>go</code>, and broadly they do.</p><p>But as we become more advanced we understand that it isn&#39;t quite that simple.</p><p>They have many metaphorical and more subtle meanings,</p><p>but even the physical meaning doesn&#39;t correspond exactly to English <code>come</code> and <code>go</code>.</p><p>Essentially, <code>iku</code> means <code>go from where the speaker is to somewhere else</code>,</p><p>and <code>kuru</code> means <code>come from somewhere else to where the speaker is</code>.</p><blockquote><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></blockquote><p>Isn&#39;t that just the same as English <code>come</code> and <code>go</code>?</p><p>Well, not quite.</p><p>For example, we can say to someone on the phone <code>Shall I come over to see you?</code></p><p>or you might say <code>Will you come to me, or shall I come to you?</code></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And in Japanese that&#39;s quite impossible, because you can&#39;t <code>come</code> to a place where you aren&#39;t.</p><p><code>Coming</code> means coming from somewhere where the speaker is not</p><p>to the place where the speaker is.</p><p>So you can&#39;t say to someone on the telephone <code>Shall I come to you?</code> with <code>来る</code>.</p><p>You can only say <code>Shall I go to you?</code> with <code>行く</code>.</p><p><code>Shall I go to you?</code> would sound strange in English,</p><p>so we see that <code>来る</code> and <code>行く</code> aren&#39;t exactly interchangeable with English <code>come</code> and <code>go</code>.</p><p><code>来る</code> can only ever mean <code>move from where the speaker isn&#39;t to where the speaker is</code>.</p><p><code>行く</code> is not quite so strict.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We can talk about someone <code>行く</code>-ing from A to B when we are actually at C,</p><p>but <code>来る</code> must always mean movement toward C, the place where we are.</p><p>And this is important to understand as we get into the more metaphorical meanings of <code>来る</code> and <code>行く</code>.</p><p>We&#39;ve talked about some of the extended meanings in an earlier lesson but still physical ones,</p><p>especially those which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsTsliRe2Cg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>involve connecting <code>来る</code> or <code>行く</code> to the te-form of a verb</strong></a>.</p><p>So <code>持ってくる</code> means <code>bring (to the place where I am)</code>;</p><p><code>持っていく</code> means <code>take (from the place where I am)</code>.</p><p>But <code>the place where I am</code> can actually be a time or it can actually be a mental state of identification.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we get more advanced meanings which are all based on the fundamental physical metaphor</p><p>of coming to the place where one is, going from the place where one is, or going from</p><p>or going one place to another (but not coming from one place to another because that isn&#39;t possible).</p><p>So, a very simple example is we may say <code>雨が降ってきた</code> --</p><p>and we have almost an equivalent English expression: we might say <code>It came on to rain</code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And the metaphor here is a time metaphor.</p><p>Rain came towards us in time, from a time when it wasn&#39;t there</p><p>to the time where we are, when the rain is there.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If we say <code>だんだん雨が降っていく</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>It&#39;s getting rainier and rainier</code></p><p>and we&#39;re projecting into the future.</p><p><code>いく</code> is moving from where we are into the future.</p><p>Now, since time, at least apparently, moves forward,</p><p>we can only use <code>いく</code> in the sense of moving forward in time,</p><p>away from us, away from the point where we are, not moving backward in time</p><p>away from the point where we are, because that isn&#39;t currently possible.</p><p>So, <code>雨が降っていく</code> in this case implies that it has become rainy (<code>降って来た</code>) and</p><p>that it&#39;s increasingly going to do so in the future.</p><p>Now, we can also use <code>くる</code> and <code>いく</code> in subtler ways still, concerned not with space or time</p><p>but with subjectivity, with our mental state.</p><p>So, a very common expression is <code>分かってくる</code>, which in English might be rendered as</p><p><code>come to understand</code>, but this of course would be wrong.<img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Let&#39;s take an example of why.</p><p>We might say <code>勉強すれば、だんだん数学が分かってくる</code></p><p>And that would be translated normally as <code>if you study, you will come to understand mathematics</code>.</p><p>And as you can see, if you&#39;ve been paying attention, there&#39;s a contradiction here.</p><p>You can&#39;t come to a place where you aren&#39;t yet in Japanese.</p><p>You can&#39;t use <code>くる</code> to speak about</p><p>coming to somewhere that you aren&#39;t at this stage but will be in the future.</p><p>It would have to be <code>いく</code>, wouldn&#39;t it?</p><p>So why is <code>くる</code> used here?</p><p>Well, if you&#39;ve followed this course you probably know the answer already.</p><p><code>分かる</code> does not mean <code>understand</code>.</p><p>It means <code>be understandable / be clear</code> or literally what it actually means is <code>do understandable</code>.</p><p>So what we&#39;re in fact saying is that if you study, math will come to be understandable to you.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In other words, math will come from being far from you to being nearer to you and being understandable.</p><p>So we&#39;re using this in a subjective sense.</p><p>And this is an important thing to understand, and it&#39;s important to understand</p><p>that <code>くる</code> and <code>いく</code> can represent movement in time, toward one or away from one,</p><p>movement in space, toward one or away from one,</p><p>movement in subjectivity, towards one&#39;s mental condition or state or away from it,</p><p>but also <code>iku</code> can represent objectivity versus <code>kuru</code> representing subjectivity.</p><p>And the reason for this is something we&#39;ve already covered,</p><p>which is that <code>iku</code> can mean moving from A to B while we are at C.</p><p>Therefore, <code>iku</code> can represent a movement from one place to another</p><p>that doesn&#39;t involve us, physically, temporally, or mentally or emotionally.</p><p>So, if we say <code>samuku natte kita</code><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>it became cold</code>, and adding that <code>kita</code> (<code>kuru</code>) is relating it to us:</p><p><code>It became cold (coming toward me or us).</code></p><p>So what we&#39;re saying is not just that it became cold,</p><p>but implying that it affects me or us subjectively: <code>Samuku natte kita</code>.</p><p>By contrast, <code>samuku natte itta</code> is more objective.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t involve us. It doesn&#39;t imply that it in any way affected me or us.</p><p>It just happened. It became colder.</p><p>Because this is the <code>itta</code> that in spatial terms is going from A to B, objectively, without involving me or us.</p><p>Now, you may be asking, &quot;How do I tell when it&#39;s movement in space, when it&#39;s movement in time,<img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>when it&#39;s movement in terms of mentality and subjectivity,</p><p>and when <code>kuru</code> and <code>iku</code> represent subjectivity versus objectivity?&quot;</p><p>And the answer to that is: There aren&#39;t any rules</p><p>and we shouldn&#39;t be looking for rules in cases like this.</p><p>The reason we learn the ways that these work is not as an end in itself, not as a set of facts to learn,</p><p>but as an aid to understanding real Japanese.</p><p>As we immerse in Japanese, as we watch anime, read novels, play games in Japanese,</p><p>these things start to make sense.<img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>What we need is the principles on which they&#39;re based,</p><p>which gives us a head start in making sense of them.</p><p>But structure is never going to substitute for immersion.</p><p>Structure is the underpinning that makes immersion quicker, and easier, and more understandable..</p>',106),f=[y];function b(_,k,v,S,I,A){return t(),o("div",null,f)}const T=e(w,[["render",b]]);export{j as __pageData,T as default};
