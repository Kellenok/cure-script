Dropped particles &amp; casual omissions | Lesson 80</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Once we start seriously immersing in</p><p>and consuming actual Japanese material,</p><p>often colloquial and casual, not textbook Japanese,</p><p>one of the problems that many people encounter is the idea that --<br> &quot;Good heavens, they leave out half of what they&#39;re going to say!</p><p>They&#39;re omitting this and leaving out that,</p><p>and how are we supposed to guess what they&#39;re actually talking about?&quot;</p><p>Now, this isn&#39;t nearly as much of a problem as it can seem at first,</p><p>but we need to know what&#39;s going on and what to look for.</p><p>So, <strong>first of all let&#39;s talk about omission in language.</strong></p><p><strong>There are fundamentally two kinds of omission in language:</strong></p><p><strong>legal omission and illegal omission.</strong></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="legal-omission" tabindex="-1">Legal Omission <a class="header-anchor" href="#legal-omission" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Legal Omission&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Legal omission is when it&#39;s perfectly grammatical</strong></p><p><strong>within the terms of a particular language to leave something out.</strong></p><p>This happens in English.</p><p>For example, if we say in English <code>The night we met</code>,</p><p>that&#39;s considered a grammatical phrase.</p><p>What we actually mean is <code>The night <strong>that</strong> we met</code>.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And <strong>in French or Spanish you can&#39;t do that.</strong></p><p><strong>You can&#39;t leave out that <code>that</code>, which is <code>que</code> in French or Spanish.</strong></p><p><strong>But in English you can.</strong></p><p>In English it&#39;s part of the rules of English grammar that</p><p>that everybody&#39;s going to understand what you mean</p><p>and you&#39;re allowed to leave it out.</p><p><strong>You can do it in an academic paper or a legal document.</strong></p><p><strong>You can do it anywhere. It&#39;s not ungrammatical.</strong></p><p>It&#39;s not an illegal omission. <strong>It&#39;s a legal omission.</strong></p><h3 id="the-zero-pronoun" tabindex="-1">The zero pronoun <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-zero-pronoun" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The zero pronoun&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, this happens <strong>in Japanese</strong>, and</p><p><strong>a very, very common example</strong>, of course, <strong>is the zero pronoun.</strong></p><p>If we say <code><em>(zeroが)</em> 疲れた</code>, which is <code>tired</code>, <strong>we mean <code>I am tired</code></strong>,</p><p>and <strong>this is a hundred percent legal, grammatical Japanese.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>You can use it in an academic essay or a legal document or anywhere.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s understood as perfectly grammatical Japanese.</strong></p><p><strong>There&#39;s no question about what you mean by it.</strong></p><p>Firstly because <strong>the zero pronoun always defaults to <code>I</code></strong></p><p>and secondly because Japanese, as we know, is very strict in saying</p><p>that we can only talk about things we are actually capable of knowing.</p><p>So we can&#39;t talk about someone else&#39;s state of emotions.</p><p><strong>We can&#39;t talk about someone else liking or disliking something.</strong></p><p><strong>We can only say that they appear to like or dislike it.</strong></p><p><strong>And we can&#39;t say that someone else is tired.</strong></p><p>So <code>疲れた</code> can only mean <code><strong>zeroが</strong>疲れた/ <strong>私が</strong>疲れた</code>.</p><p>So <strong>this is a legal omission.</strong></p><h2 id="illegal-omission" tabindex="-1">Illegal omission <a class="header-anchor" href="#illegal-omission" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Illegal omission&quot;">​</a></h2><p>But there&#39;s also a lot of illegal omission that goes on in all languages,</p><p>and <strong>in casual speech</strong> as opposed to very formal speech <strong>it&#39;s completely legal</strong>.</p><p>So <strong>strictly speaking it&#39;s illegal, but in terms of ordinary, everyday, casual speech, it&#39;s legal.</strong></p><p>So what kinds of accepted but strictly illegal omission are there?</p><p>Fundamentally, three kinds.</p><h3 id="leaving-out-bits-of-words-or-phrases" tabindex="-1">Leaving out bits of words or phrases <a class="header-anchor" href="#leaving-out-bits-of-words-or-phrases" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Leaving out bits of words or phrases&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The first is when we leave out bits of words or phrases.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, for example, instead of <code>している</code> (am doing / is doing) we say <code>してる</code>;</p><p>instead of <code>しておく</code> (do and put in place) we say <code>しとく</code>.</p><p>Now, <strong>these are such regular illegalities that they&#39;re really no different from saying</strong></p><p><strong><code>shouldn&#39;t</code> or <code>hadn&#39;t</code> in place of <code>should not</code> or <code>had not</code> in English.</strong></p><p><strong>You can use them almost anywhere, but not in the most formal circumstances.</strong></p><p>A little bit further down the scale, we have things like saying</p><p><code>分かんない</code> instead of <code>分からない</code>,</p><p>or <code>つまんない</code> instead of <code>つまらない</code>.</p><p>So that&#39;s one type, and although it may take a little while to get used to the expressions,</p><p>once you know them they&#39;re no more difficult than anything else.</p><hr><p><strong>The other thing that gets left out a lot is anything that attaches to a noun.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>As I&#39;ve said before, <strong>Japanese is a very noun-centered language.</strong></p><p>And, as you know <em>(Lesson 8b)</em>, <strong>nouns always have something stuck to them</strong>:</p><p><strong>a logical particle to tell us what role they play in the sentence</strong>,</p><p><strong>sometimes a non-logical particle, and sometimes a copula</strong>.</p><p>Now, <strong>just about all of these can be dropped at some time.</strong></p><p><strong>If it&#39;s clear without the marker what role a noun is playing in the sentence</strong>,</p><p><strong>we can in casual speech</strong>, not in formal speech, but in casual speech,</p><p><strong>we can leave off that marker.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>The markers that get left off most often are</strong></p><p><strong>が, を</strong>, and <strong>the non-logical topic marker は</strong>, and also <strong>the copula <code>だ</code>.</strong></p><p>So, for example, if I say <code>私アンドロイド</code>,</p><p><strong>I&#39;ve left off what would probably have been a は after my name.</strong></p><p><strong>I&#39;ve also left off <code>だ</code> after <code>アンドロイド</code></strong>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, if you know that I&#39;m introducing myself or saying something about myself,</p><p>there&#39;s no doubt about what&#39;s going on here.</p><p>And... I don&#39;t want to go back too much to the subject of Tae Kim-sensei,</p><p>I&#39;ve done a three-part series about the things Tae Kim-sensei teaches</p><p>that he actually shouldn&#39;t be teaching, and I&#39;ll link to that <em>(Lessons 77, 78, 79)</em>,</p><p>but what I will do here is make a point that I didn&#39;t make there</p><p><strong>which is that Tae Kim-sensei says that because <code>だ</code> is often dropped and <code>です</code> is not dropped,</strong></p><p><em>(according to him)</em> they&#39;re not really the same thing, they&#39;re not both the copula.</p><h3 id="why-だ-is-often-dropped-and-です-isn-t" tabindex="-1">Why だ is often dropped and です isn’t <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-だ-is-often-dropped-and-です-isn-t" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why だ is often dropped and です isn’t&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And I&#39;ve dealt with this at length and I&#39;ve explained what a mess it makes of Japanese</p><p>if you ignore the copula, so I won&#39;t go over that again.</p><p>But the point I do want to make here is that</p><p>the reason that <code>だ</code> can be dropped in places where <code>です</code> can&#39;t are twofold.</p><p>First of all, <strong>why can <code>だ</code> be dropped as often as it is?</strong></p><p>Well, if the textbooks taught us the basic structure of Japanese,</p><p>it would be obvious, but of course they don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>The most basic thing about Japanese structure is that a Japanese sentence can only end in one of three ways.</strong></p><p>And I think you know what those three ways are, don&#39;t you? Let&#39;s say it together.</p><p><strong>A Japanese sentence can only end with a verb, an adjective, or a noun-plus-copula.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, once we know that, we know why the copula can get left off very easily.</p><p><strong>As I said before, particles and the copula get left off</strong></p><p><strong>where it&#39;s obvious what the nouns were without marking them.</strong> That&#39;s when they get left off.</p><hr><p>Now, <strong>if a noun comes at the end of the sentence, we know that it&#39;s not a verb sentence.</strong></p><p><strong>We know that it&#39;s not an adjective sentence.</strong></p><p><strong>We know that it&#39;s a noun-plus-copula sentence.</strong></p><p>And <strong>since we know that, we can, if we want to, drop the copula.</strong></p><p>And this, I think, is why Tae Kim-sensei gets lured into saying that <code>だ</code> is a declarative,</p><p>a sort of verbal exclamation mark.</p><p>What he&#39;s saying is that people use <code>だ</code> when they want to stress what they&#39;re saying.</p><p>Well, <strong>there&#39;s a certain amount of truth in that because the fact is</strong></p><p><strong>that you can in casual speech always drop the copula and still be understood,</strong></p><p><strong>so if you&#39;re speaking at the kind of casual level where you probably would be dropping it,</strong></p><p><strong>then when you include it is when you want to stress what you&#39;re saying.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>It&#39;s not really as simple as that, because a lot of people don&#39;t drop it,</strong></p><p><strong>not everybody drops it all the time.</strong> It&#39;s a bit more complex than that,</p><p><strong>but the idea that it is a declarative at least has that grain of truth in it</strong></p><p><strong>that because you can drop it pretty much whenever you want to in casual speech,</strong></p><p><strong>you often include it because you want to stress it.</strong></p><p>So if it&#39;s easy to drop the copula when it&#39;s <code>だ</code>,</p><p><strong>why isn&#39;t it easy to drop it when it&#39;s <code>です</code>?</strong></p><p>Tae Kim-sensei turns this into a whole argument</p><p>for the fact that <code>だ</code> and <code>です</code> are two different things,</p><p>but if you think about it it&#39;s perfectly obvious why <code>だ</code> does get dropped</p><p>(I&#39;ve explained that already) and why <code>です</code> doesn&#39;t.</p><p><strong><code>です</code> doesn&#39;t get dropped because it&#39;s formal speech.</strong></p><p><strong>In the first place, we drop less in formal speech.</strong></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We don&#39;t drop as many things in a formal sentence as we do in an informal sentence.</p><p><strong>But even if we&#39;re speaking formal speech at a loose level,</strong></p><p><strong>where we can be dropping things out of the sentence,</strong></p><p><strong>we won&#39;t drop the <code>です</code>.</strong></p><p>Why not?</p><p>Because there&#39;s only one thing that makes 丁寧語 (です/ます level speech) into 丁寧語,</p><p><strong>and that&#39;s the fact that we add the <code>ます</code> helper verb to the end of verb sentences</strong></p><p><strong>and the <code>です</code> copula to the end of noun-plus-copula sentences</strong></p><p><strong>and even, redundantly, to the end of adjective sentences.</strong></p><p><strong>So you can&#39;t, in 丁寧語, drop the <code>です</code> without dropping the 丁寧語.</strong></p><p>It&#39;s as simple as that.</p><hr><p>Now, <strong>there are various rules about when you can and can&#39;t</strong></p><p><strong>drop things like を out of a casual sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Obviously it’s a joke…just in case (ノ*°▽°*)</p></div><p><strong>You can in theory drop something whenever it isn&#39;t needed.</strong></p><p><strong>In practice there are places where it seems natural</strong></p><p><strong>and other places where it doesn&#39;t seem natural.</strong></p><p>If you want to know the rules for it, sometimes they&#39;re very complex</p><p>and even when they&#39;re very complex they don&#39;t necessarily work all the time.</p><p>But you don&#39;t need to know that.</p><p>Why don&#39;t you need to know it?</p><p>Well, let&#39;s think about this.</p><p><strong>You need to know that they can be dropped and you need to know that</strong></p><p><strong>they&#39;re dropped in places where you can actually work out what they were going to be.</strong></p><p>Once you know that, you&#39;re not swimming in an ocean of strange vagueness</p><p>where things get dropped and you&#39;ve no idea what they are.</p><p><strong>What you don&#39;t need is to be able to reproduce very casual Japanese</strong></p><p><strong>in exactly the way that Japanese people do it.</strong></p><p>And <strong>that&#39;s the only reason you&#39;d need to learn these strange lists of rules.</strong></p><p>If you just use all the particles all the time, occasionally,</p><p>especially when you&#39;re speaking casual Japanese,</p><p>your Japanese will sound a bit stilted.</p><p>Well, what about that?</p><p><strong>Language spoken by foreigners usually does sound a little bit stilted, doesn&#39;t it?</strong></p><p>You&#39;ve probably noticed that in English.</p><p><strong>If you&#39;re going to be using Japanese a lot, gradually, bit by bit,</strong></p><p><strong>you&#39;ll get used to the places where you can naturally drop things.</strong></p><p><strong>If you&#39;re not going to be using Japanese a lot,</strong></p><p><strong>why do you want to sit down and learn a bunch of rules</strong></p><p><strong>in order that you can pretend that you&#39;ve naturally acquired Japanese</strong></p><p><strong>when not only haven&#39;t you, but you&#39;ve no intention of doing so?</strong></p><hr><p><strong>So my advice to you is <code>Learn Japanese naturally</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>Don&#39;t try to memorize sets of rules when all they could possibly do is make you seem</strong></p><p><strong>as if you&#39;re more used to Japanese than you actually are.</strong></p><p><strong>But in practice they&#39;re not even going to do that, because you will make mistakes.</strong></p><p><strong>The important thing to understand is how things get dropped in Japanese,</strong></p><p><strong>why they get dropped in Japanese, and</strong></p><p><strong>how to understand them when they have been dropped.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Great advice indeed, Dolly (o≧▽゜)o</p></div><h3 id="dropping-entire-clauses" tabindex="-1">Dropping entire clauses <a class="header-anchor"
