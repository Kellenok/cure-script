So what is <code>気</code>?</p><p><code>気</code> comes from Chinese.</p><p><s>The kanji is the same kanji that we have in <code>tai chi</code>.</s></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Dolly erred here, 気 is not used in 太極. Luckily, one <code>nleseul</code> clears it up, kudos to them.*<br><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div><p>It&#39;s a Daoist concept and probably goes back to a time before what we now know as Daoism.</p><p>To this day the concept is used in Chinese medicine, Chinese and Japanese martial arts, and other areas.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>What it is is the fundamental spirit of fluid energy in a person or something else.</p><p>Originally it was associated with breath,</p><p>and in many languages, <code>breath</code> and <code>spirit</code> are in fact the same word.</p><p>Latin <code>spiritus</code>, Greek <code>pneuma</code>, Hebrew <code>ruach</code>, Sanskrit <code>atma</code>:</p><p>all mean both breath and spirit.</p><p>Now, the breath meaning of <code>気</code> is no longer active,</p><p>but it&#39;s still this flowing spirit principle within a person.</p><hr><p>If we look at the kanji, interestingly, this part of it 气 <em><strong>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Radical 84</a>)</strong></em></p><p>(which is also pronounced <code>き</code>) means steam or vapor.</p><p>So, a <code>汽車</code> is a steam engine.</p><p>And then we have this <code>メ</code>, as it were, and here <code>メ</code> really <code>marks the spot</code>. (気)<br><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We have the fixed cross portion and we have the fluid, vaporous portion.</p><p>And both of those aspects of <code>気</code> are important, and you can never entirely separate the two,</p><p>although we can move from the fixed end of the scale to the fluid end of the scale.</p><p>So, to give examples of those two ends of the scale, let&#39;s take two expressions that you almost certainly know.</p><hr><p>The first is <code>元気</code>, the second is <code>やる気</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>元気</code>, as you know, is vigor or health.</p><p>The <code>元</code> means original, fundamental.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, one&#39;s original <code>気</code> is healthy and vigorous.</p><p>If something goes wrong, we may become <code>病気</code> (sick or dispirited).</p><p>And our aim is then to return our <code>気</code> to its original</p><p>healthy and vigorous state, to restore our <code>元気</code>.</p><p><code>やる気</code> is the will to do something.</p><p>So it&#39;s the do-spirit, get-up-and-go-spirit.</p><p>And this kind of <code>気</code> is not our basic <code>気</code> that in a sense remains constant within us.</p><p>It&#39;s a particular <code>気</code>, the <code>気</code> to do a particular thing.</p><p>So we might say</p><p><code>海外で勉強する気がある</code></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And what we&#39;re saying here is that a particular <code>気</code> exists in us that is the <code>気</code> to study abroad.</p><p>So in this sense <code>気</code> is the will or inclination to do a particular thing.</p><p>When we say <code>気を付ける</code>, this literally means attach or stick your spirit.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So if someone said <code>階段に気を付ける</code>,</p><p>what they&#39;re literally saying is <code>attach your spirit to the staircase</code>.</p><p>Now, what we&#39;d say in English is <code>watch out for the staircase</code> or <code>take care on the staircase</code>.</p><p>Attach your spirit, your consciousness, your feelings, your thoughts, to the staircase;</p><p>pay attention to it; take care.</p><p>And it may not be a particular thing.</p><p>Very often people say <code>気を付けて</code> (attach your spirit).</p><p>And this is not attach it to any particular thing,</p><p>but attach it to whatever it&#39;s appropriate to attach it to;</p><p>have situational awareness, as one might say in a more modern jargon; take care.</p><h2 id="気になる-気にする" tabindex="-1">気になる &amp; 気にする <a class="header-anchor" href="#気になる-気にする" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;気になる &amp; 気にする&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, when we get on to things like <code>気になる</code> and <code>気にする</code> --</p><p>we&#39;ve dealt in a previous lesson with <code>になる</code> and <code>にする</code>.　<em>(not sure, possibly Lesson 8 &amp; 18)</em></p><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, for example, if we say <code>さくらがカエルになる</code>, we&#39;re saying Sakura turns into a frog.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If we say <code>魔女がさくらをカエルにする</code>, we&#39;re saying that a witch turns Sakura into a frog.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And of course we know who is doing what because of the logical particles.</p><p>So what does it mean when we talk about <code>気になる</code> and <code>気にする</code>?</p><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We&#39;re saying that something becomes our spirit. What would we mean by that?</p><p>Well, to understand that we need to understand something else.</p><p>We need to understand that becoming a feeling, an emotion,</p><p>the expression of emotion, is something that we do in Japanese.</p><p>We don&#39;t do it in English.</p><p>So, for example, in AKB48&#39;s song <code>Heavy Rotation</code> we have the line:</p><p><code>こんな気持ちになれるって僕はついているね</code></p><p>And this means <code>That I could become this feeling, I&#39;m lucky, aren&#39;t I?</code></p><p>Now, in English we don&#39;t talk about <code>becoming</code> a feeling, but in Japanese we do talk about that.</p><p>And I think this is somewhat connected with the concept of <code>気</code></p><p>and also with the Buddhist idea that there really is no self.</p><p>What we are is not a fixed and absolute thing.</p><p>The self is essentially a shifting congeries of actions and reactions, feelings and sensations.</p><p>And so we may temporarily become a particular feeling.</p><p>You may even become, in Japanese, the expression of a feeling.</p><p>We may say <code>深刻な表情になる</code> -- someone became a grave or concerned face.</p><p>For that moment, the whole person transformed into that expression of gravity and concern.</p><p>Now, this is what we&#39;re saying when we say <code>気になる</code> and <code>気にする</code>.</p><p>If we say <code>あの人は気になる</code>, we&#39;re saying that person turns into my spirit.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>My spirit is remolded, as it were, a certain part of it, for a certain period,</p><p>into the form or shape of that person.</p><p>What does that mean? It means that that person is,</p><p>as we would say in English, occupying my feelings.</p><p>Now, this can mean a variety of things.</p><p>It can mean that we&#39;re concerned or worried about that person.</p><p>It can mean that that person intrigues us.</p><p>It can mean that we feel there&#39;s some mystery about that person.</p><p>Or whatever it is, that person is occupying our feelings, our sensations, our thoughts;</p><p>in Japanese, is becoming our feelings, our sensations, our thoughts, our <code>気</code>.</p><p>Now, an important thing to notice here is that we tend to see in grammar books and dictionaries</p><p><code><strong>気になる</strong> means this</code>, <code><strong>気にする</strong> means that</code>, but the important thing to understand is</p><p>that <code>気になる</code> on its own doesn&#39;t mean anything. Neither does <code>気にする</code>.</p><p><code>気になる</code> is the tail-end of a complete logical clause.</p><p><code>なる</code> is the engine, <code>気に</code> is telling us more about the engine.</p><p>The A-car in the case of <code>気になる</code> is whatever it is that&#39;s occupying our thoughts,</p><p>whatever it is that&#39;s turning into our spirit.</p><p>So in this case <code>あの人</code> is the A-car and what we&#39;re saying about that person,</p><p>what that person is doing, is turning into our spirit.</p><p>Now, when we take <code>気にする</code>, we say <code>あの人を気にする</code>.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So now the doer of the action is not that person; the doer of the action is me.</p><p>I am turning that person into my spirit.</p><p>I am being concerned about that person.</p><p>And that has two implications.</p><p>One is that in a sense we&#39;re doing violence to our spirit.</p><p>It&#39;s not just our spirit naturally becoming that person -- we are making it so.</p><p>And that tends to give it a slightly more negative meaning.</p><p>While <code>気になる</code> can occupy a whole spectrum of meaning</p><p>from being intrigued to being worried,</p><p><code>気にする</code> usually means worried.</p><p>Now, the other implication it has is that we&#39;re in control of it.</p><p>Our spirit isn&#39;t simply turning into that person.</p><p>We are turning our spirit into that person.</p><p>And that&#39;s why you often hear people say <code>気にしないで</code> (don&#39;t turn it into your spirit).</p><p>It wouldn&#39;t make any sense to say <code>気にならないで</code>, because you aren&#39;t making anything happen.</p><p>Your spirit&#39;s simply turning into it.</p><p>But <code>気にしないで</code> is telling you to control something that you have control over:</p><p><code>Don&#39;t turn it into your spirit; don&#39;t worry about it; don&#39;t be concerned.</code></p><p>Now, we have <code>気にする</code> and <code>気になる</code>.</p><h2 id="気がする" tabindex="-1">気がする <a class="header-anchor" href="#気がする" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;気がする&quot;">​</a></h2><p>What about <code>気がする</code>?</p><p>Again, the particle gives us the clue to what&#39;s going on.</p><p>When we say <code>気がする</code>, it&#39;s the <code>気</code>, the spirit itself, that&#39;s acting.</p><p>It&#39;s not something becoming our spirit, it&#39;s not us turning something into our spirit.</p><p>It&#39;s our spirit doing something or a certain aspect of our spirit acting (<code>する</code>, do or act).</p><p>How do we understand this?</p><p>Well, again we need to understand something else</p><p>in Japanese before we can properly understand this.</p><p>When we use expressions like <code>いい匂いがする</code> or <code>綺麗な音がする</code>,</p><p>what we&#39;re saying is <code>There&#39;s a good smell</code>,</p><p><code>There&#39;s a pretty sound / a pretty sound happened / a pretty sound acted</code>.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>What we mean by <code>する</code> in the case of a smell or a sound</p><p>is the only thing a smell or a sound can do: a smell smells and a sound sounds.</p><p>When we say <code>匂いがする</code>, we&#39;re saying that a smell acts, a smell is active, I can detect a smell.</p><p><code>音がする</code>: a sound acts, a sound is active, I can detect a sound.</p><p>When we say <code>気がする</code>, we&#39;re saying a certain spirit, a certain thought, a certain consciousness is active,</p><p>I can detect that consciousness, I can detect that feeling.</p><p>So, if we say <code>騙されているような気がする</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying &quot;I&#39;ve got a feeling we&#39;re being deceived,</p><p>I&#39;ve got a feeling we&#39;re being tricked&quot; --</p><p>such a <code>気</code>, such a feeling, is active.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If we say <code>強くなった気がする</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>I feel that I got stronger, I sense that I got stronger</code> --</p><p>that spirit, that inclination of the emotions, of the thoughts, is active</p><p>in the same way that a smell is active or a noise is active.</p><h2 id="気に入る" tabindex="-1">気に入る <a class="header-anchor" href="#気に入る" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;気に入る&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, one last one that I think is more confusing than the others</p><p>because essentially it uses a word in an uncommon way is <code>気にいる</code>.</p><p>If we say <code>それを気に入る</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I like that</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>それが気に入る is also possible. As Dolly gives with これを気に入る.</p></div><p>Now, what we&#39;re really saying is that I&#39;m letting that into my soul.</p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>What&#39;s confusing here is that <code>入る/いる</code> is not being used in its normal way.</p><p><code>入る</code> usually means to enter or come in.</p><p>And if we&#39;re talking about putting something into something, we say <code>入れる</code>.</p><p>But in this case, <code>入る</code>, probably because it&#39;s an older usage</p><p>that&#39;s cemented into the language in this particular very common phrase,</p><p><code>入る</code> actually means allow into one&#39;s spirit.</p><p>So, the one who is doing <code>気に入る</code> is oneself.</p><p>And we know that is the case because that&#39;s the way the particles are working.</p><p>We can always trust the particles.</p><p>If the particles are saying one thing and the form of the word is saying another,</p><p>we can be confident in every case that the particles know what they&#39;re talking about</p><p>and the word may have changed its meaning over time.</p><p><code>気に入る</code> is something you&#39;ll hear on various occasions,</p><p>and a particular characteristic of this</p><p>is that it&#39;s much easier to use it about other people than things like <code>欲しい</code> or <code>好き</code>.</p><p>This is not to say that we can baldly state what other people like and what they don&#39;t like,</p><p>even using <code>気に入る</code>, but if we&#39;re going to talk about other people&#39;s feelings,</p><p>ask them about their feelings, suggest what their feelings might be,</p><p><code>気に入る</code> is much politer than using terms like <code>たい</code> or <code>好き</code> or <code>欲しい</code>.</p><p>So you&#39;ll very often see <code>気に入る</code> in references to other people&#39;s feelings<br> as well as to one&#39;s own.</p><p>So, I hope this makes the whole <code>気</code> usage a little clearer…</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>The Buddhist concept of <code>non-self</code></strong></a> may be a good study to see how Japanese works.</p></div><p><img src="'+_+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>',205),I=[v];function A(S,x,W,z,N,T){return a(),o("div",null,I)}const O=t(k,[["render",A]]);export{D as __pageData,O as default};
