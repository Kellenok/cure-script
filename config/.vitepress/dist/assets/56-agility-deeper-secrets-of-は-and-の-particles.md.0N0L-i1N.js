Deeper secrets of は and の particles| Lesson 56</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about a topic that isn&#39;t often referred to,</p><p>which is agility in language.</p><p>And I&#39;m not talking about my ability or your ability in language.</p><p>I&#39;m talking about the agility of language itself,</p><p>the ability of languages to express certain things</p><p>in economical, swift-footed ways that other languages find more difficult.</p><p>And this is important because when languages have greater agility</p><p>in particular forms of expression they use them in ways that seem quite unfamiliar and strange to people whose languages can&#39;t handle those forms of expression in the same agile manner.</p><p>And this often leaves learners quite puzzled as to what&#39;s going on in a lot of sentences.</p><p>So, I&#39;m going to start off with one of the most fundamental</p><p>and structural causes of this problem, and that is the topic-marking particle は.</p><h2 id="particle-は" tabindex="-1">Particle は <a class="header-anchor" href="#particle-は" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Particle は&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Once people get the idea that は is a topic-marker and is always a topic-marker,</p><p>they often then start to say, &quot;Well, why are we using a topic-marker?</p><p>Why are we saying &#39;as for this apple&#39; in places where it seems really not</p><p>something we would do in English or in many other languages?&quot;</p><p>Now, the reason for this has to do of course with the fact that Japanese is what linguists call <code>a topic-prominent language</code>.</p><p>Topic-comment structure is very fundamental to Japanese in a way that it isn&#39;t to English,</p><p>and I&#39;m going to talk about that at greater length in a future video.</p><p>But currently what I want to talk about is how this affects the matter of agility,</p><p>how it makes the formation of a topic a very lightweight, a very agile, a very quick-footed operation, which in other languages, like English, it isn&#39;t.</p><p>So, I&#39;m going to reintroduce a sentence I used</p><p>in my first advanced lesson on the use of the は-particle,</p><p>and that is: <code>アフリカはライオンはいるがトラはいない</code></p><p>Now, as you see, we have three はs in the space of a very short sentence</p><p>and they are indeed all topic-markers, because は <strong>always</strong> is a topic-marker.</p><p>And I have explained what&#39;s going on, but we&#39;re going to look at this in terms of agility.</p><p>What&#39;s going on, of course, is that the first は is the overall topic-marker.</p><p>It&#39;s saying <code>アフリカは...</code> -- <code>Speaking of Africa...</code></p><p>and everything that follows is going to be a comment on the topic of Africa.</p><p>What follows a は-marked topic has to be a logical clause.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter how small it is, but it must be a logical clause.</p><p>And it must contain both the necessary elements of a logical clause just like any other.</p><p>What we have here in fact is a logical sentence consisting of two logical clauses</p><p>and each of them contains what we might call a subtopic.</p><p>That&#39;s to say, each logical clause in itself also has a topic statement preceding it.</p><p>So if we write it out in full, it would be</p><p><code>アフリカはライオンは<strong>zeroが</strong>いるがトラは<strong>zeroが</strong>いない</code></p><p>So the two logical clauses are <code>zeroがいる</code> and <code>zeroがいない</code>,</p><p>but both of them state their own subtopics.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, why are they doing that?</p><p>Well, we know this already.</p><p>It&#39;s because は is used to distinguish things.</p><p>So what we&#39;re saying here is &quot;Speaking of Africa, speaking of lions, they exist,</p><p>but speaking of tigers, they don&#39;t exist.&quot;</p><p>Now, I think we can see how this works in English and</p><p>how it uses topic-marking to distinguish two different states of affairs.</p><p>But this isn&#39;t something we would ever say in English. Why not?</p><p>Because this <code>speaking of</code> in English is not agile at all.</p><p>It&#39;s setting up a rather dramatic and heavy, cumbersome way of introducing a subject.</p><p>We can&#39;t just keep saying <code>speaking of</code> in a sentence,</p><p>because <code>speaking of</code> and the various other ways</p><p>that we introduce topics in English are not agile.</p><p>Japanese は is very, very agile.</p><p>We can freely throw it in wherever we want to create a distinction like this,</p><p>because は distinguishes things.</p><p>When we change a topic using は, we are implicitly saying that</p><p>the comment on the new topic is different from the comment on the old topic.</p><p>If we want to say that the comment is the same,</p><p>then we have to use the other topic-marker, も.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And this sentence actually doubles down on that</p><p>by giving a は to both the compounded logical clauses.</p><p>So we&#39;re saying <code>speaking of lions...</code> this topic has a comment</p><p>which is different from another topic that may be nearby.</p><p>But <code>speaking of lions, they exist</code>,</p><p>and then <code>speaking of tigers...</code> this topic also has a comment</p><p>that will differ from the comment on any nearby topic: <code>they don&#39;t exist</code>.</p><p>Now, as you see, this is a very cumbersome process if we think about it in English.</p><p>But if we understand it in Japanese, if we know how the は-particle is used lightly and</p><p>easily and agilely in this kind of circumstance, it ceases to be a problem.</p><h2 id="particle-の" tabindex="-1">Particle の <a class="header-anchor" href="#particle-の" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Particle の&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, another area where we often get confusion because of the agility of a Japanese element</p><p>in comparison to any way we would imitate it in English is the の-particle,</p><p>the so-called nominalizing の,</p><p>which acts as a pronoun and bundles everything coming before it,</p><p>everything modifying it, into a noun-box, into a single noun-like entity.</p><p>And one of my patrons asked me this question, and it&#39;s a short sentence and it ought to be fairly simple, but my patron found it quite difficult, and I think a lot of people find this sort of thing quite difficult.</p><p>Not because it is difficult, not because the structure is actually hard to parse,</p><p>but because it&#39;s very unlike what we would do in English or many other languages, under the same circumstances.</p><p>So, this comes from a Disney song, <code>The Bells of Notre Dame</code>,</p><p>and the first line is <code>朝のパリに響くのは鐘だよ</code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, as you see, this is quite a short and simple-looking sentence.</p><p>But can you see where the A and the B of this sentence are?</p><p>My patron suggested that this meant <code>A bell resounds in morning Paris</code></p><p>and that&#39;s more the sort of thing we would be saying in English.</p><p>But we can see that this is in fact an A-is-B sentence and we can see also that it has a は-marked topic and that the は-marked topic comes quite near the end.</p><p>So the A-is-B, the logical structure, has to come after the は-marked topic.</p><p>So what&#39;s the は-marked topic?</p><p><strong>The は-marked topic is <code>朝のパリに響くの</code>.</strong></p><p>So の is bundling the rest of it, <code>in morning-Paris-resoundsの</code>,</p><p>in other words <code>that which resounds in morning Paris</code>.</p><p>And then of course we must have a logical が-marked subject</p><p>which has been defined for us by that の.</p><p>So, <code>that which resounds in morning Paris, it is (or they are) bells, よ.</code></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So why is it being put in this way?</p><p>You might say, because it can be.</p><p>In English, this is difficult.</p><p>In English, <code>that which resounds in morning Paris, that&#39;s bells</code> doesn&#39;t sound natural at all.</p><p>And the reason is because setting up a topic like</p><p><code>that which resounds in morning Paris</code> is not straightforward in English.</p><p>It&#39;s not agile; it&#39;s cumbersome; it&#39;s large; it&#39;s slow-footed.</p><p>But in Japanese we do this all the time.</p><p>We say things like <code>That which she saw when she went into the room was...</code></p><p>Now, in English we&#39;re much more likely to say</p><p><code>When she went into the room she saw...</code></p><p>or <code>In Paris in the morning bells resound throughout the city.</code></p><p>If we want to use this <code>that which...</code> kind of structure,</p><p>we have to have built up to it.</p><p>If we, for example, have spent some time establishing</p><p>the fact that she&#39;s nervous about what she&#39;s going to see</p><p>when she opens the door and looks into the room, then we can say</p><p><code>What she saw when she looked in the room was...</code></p><p>But we need to have set that up.</p><p>We need to have made some kind of preparation to use that form,</p><p>because it&#39;s not agile.</p><p>It&#39;s not a lightweight thing that we can just slip in anywhere.</p><p>On the other hand, Japanese can use this as a narrative technique,</p><p>setting up anticipation of what she saw and resolving it very quickly over the course of a short sentence and without making any fuss about it,<br> because it&#39;s a light, agile verbal formula.</p><p>And because of that, you&#39;re going to see it all over the place in Japanese,</p><p>so you need to get used to it.</p><p>But really the important point of this lesson</p><p>is the concept of agility itself,</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>because we&#39;re going to come across in Japanese as we go forward</p><p>various cases where Japanese uses expression strategies<br> which may seem very unnatural and strange when you try to translate them into English,</p><p>because the English equivalents are not agile</p><p>and the Japanese equivalents are very agile and lightweight.</p><p>And one of the things about being agile and lightweight</p><p>is not so much that it&#39;s easy to say in itself</p><p>but that it&#39;s easy to shoehorn into the middle of saying something else.</p><p>In other words, it doesn&#39;t have to be the main point of the statement.</p><p>In English you can&#39;t say things like <code>speaking of...</code> or <code>as for...</code></p><p>unless that&#39;s going to be the main point of the statement.</p><p>But in Japanese you can because it&#39;s lighter, it&#39;s more agile…</p>',141),l=[c];function d(g,u,m,f,w,y){return a(),t("div",null,l)}const v=e(h,[["render",d]]);export{k as __pageData,v as default};
