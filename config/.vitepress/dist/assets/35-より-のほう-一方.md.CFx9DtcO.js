So, if we say <code>さくらはメアリよりきれいだ</code></p><p>we&#39;re saying that <code>from Mary</code> Sakura is pretty.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>What we mean by this is that distinguished from Mary, Sakura is pretty.</p><p>Now, it does have something in common with <code>から</code> because we&#39;re still using Mary as the base point, the point of comparison.</p><p>And because of this, because it has a comparative meaning, we&#39;re <strong>not</strong> saying Sakura is pretty but Mary isn&#39;t.</p><p>We&#39;re saying that, taking Mary as the point of comparison,<br> Sakura is pretty -- therefore, more pretty, prettier.</p><p>In comparison to Mary, going <code>from</code> Mary, Sakura is pretty.</p><p>And you notice here that we said just what that first sentence,</p><p><code>メアリよりさくらのほうがきれいだ,</code> was saying and we didn&#39;t need <code>ほう</code>.</p><p>It works perfectly well to say exactly the same thing without that <code>ほう</code>.</p><p>And we use <code>より</code> in other contexts.</p><p>For example, we may say <code>今年の冬はいつもより寒い,</code> which literally means</p><p><code>Comparing from always, this year&#39;s winter is cold</code> or <code>This year&#39;s winter is colder than always.</code></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And what that actually means is <code>This year&#39;s winter is colder than usual, colder than most other years.</code></p><p>So that <code>always</code> is a kind of hyperbole, in a way.</p><p>Similarly, we can say <code>さくらは人より賢い(かしこい)</code> -- <code>Sakura is clever compared to people.</code></p><p>And what that means, again, is &quot;Sakura is clever compared to most people / Sakura is</p><p>clever compared to people in general<code> -- in other words, is cleverer </code>than&quot; the average person.</p><p>All right, so now let&#39;s look at <code>ほう</code>.</p><h2 id="ほう" tabindex="-1">ほう <a class="header-anchor" href="#ほう" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ほう&quot;">​</a></h2><p><code>ほう</code> is quite different.</p><p>It&#39;s not a particle, it&#39;s a noun.</p><p>That&#39;s why we have <code>のほう</code>.</p><p>And its literal meaning is a <code>direction</code> or a <code>side</code>.</p><p>And when we say <code>side</code>, we mean <code>side</code> in the sense of <code>direction</code>,<br> not in the sense of <code>edge</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, for example, if we talk about two sides of a field with <code>ほう</code>, we&#39;re not meaning the</p><p>two edges of the field, we&#39;re meaning that we divide it approximately in half</p><p>and we talk about <code>the left side</code> and <code>the right side</code> of the field.</p><p>Now, as we see from this analogy, one side always implies the other side.</p><p>And that&#39;s the important thing about <code>ほう</code> in its metaphorical uses.</p><p>In its literal use, when I&#39;m cycling in Japan, I might say to a stranger,</p><p>pointing in the direction I&#39;m going in, <code>それは本町の方向ですか?</code></p><p>And that&#39;s saying <code>Is that the direction of Honmachi?</code></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>I&#39;m not asking for street directions, which I can&#39;t understand in English, or Japanese,</p><p>or any other language.</p><p>I&#39;m asking for the literal direction: <code>Is Honmachi that way, or am I going in the opposite direction?</code> – which I often am, because I am <code>方向音痴 / ほうこうおんち</code>, which means (I) have no sense of direction.</p><p>So when we apply it metaphorically, we mean one thing or circumstance or whatever as opposed to another.</p><p>We can put it after a noun with の, as we do with Sakura: <code>さくらのほう</code>,<br> or we can put it after a verb or an adjective, in which case that verb or adjective is describing the <code>ほう</code>, telling us what kind of a <code>ほう</code> it is, which <code>side</code> it is.</p><p>So, if you say to me <code>メアリがきれいだと思う?</code></p><p>-- <code>Do you think Mary is pretty?</code> -- and I reply <code>さくらのほうがきれいだ</code>, I&#39;m saying</p><p><code>The side of Sakura is pretty</code> -- in other words, I think Sakura is prettier.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Once again, it&#39;s a comparative construction, so I&#39;m not saying Sakura is pretty and Mary isn&#39;t, but I am saying that the side of Sakura is prettier than the other side, which is Mary.</p><p>And, once again, let&#39;s notice that we don&#39;t need <code>より</code> here.</p><p><code>さくらのほうがきれいだ</code> works perfectly happily on its own to mean exactly the same thing. And a lot of the time you&#39;re going to see either <code>より</code> or <code>のほう</code> on their own.</p><p>We do sometimes use the two together and when we&#39;re doing that we&#39;re either speaking fairly formally or we&#39;re really trying to underline the point of the difference and comparison between the two.</p><h2 id="一方-いっぽう" tabindex="-1">一方 (いっぽう) <a class="header-anchor" href="#一方-いっぽう" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;一方 (いっぽう)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Another case in which we see <code>ほう</code> is in the expression <code>一方</code>, which means <code>one side</code>.</p><p>And we can see this often used in narrative, sometimes right at the beginning of a sentence -- not just a sentence, but a paragraph, and indeed a whole section of the story.</p><p>And what it&#39;s doing when we do this is it&#39;s saying essentially what we mean in English</p><p>when we say <code>meanwhile</code>.</p><p>But we shouldn&#39;t say that <code>一方</code> means <code>meanwhile</code>, because it doesn&#39;t.</p><p><code>Meanwhile</code> is a time expression. It&#39;s saying <code>at the same time</code>.</p><p><code>一方</code>, while performing the same function, does it quite differently.</p><p>What we say when we say <code>一方</code> before going into something else, is really referring back to what we were talking about before, whatever that was.</p><p>And we&#39;re saying <code>All that was the one side; and now we&#39;re going to look at the other side.</code></p><p>It&#39;s like <code>でも</code>, which wraps up whatever it was went before with <code>で</code> which is the て-form of <code>です</code> – <code>all that was, all that existed</code> -- <code>も</code> gives us the contrasting conjunction:<br><code>でも</code> -- <code>but</code>.
