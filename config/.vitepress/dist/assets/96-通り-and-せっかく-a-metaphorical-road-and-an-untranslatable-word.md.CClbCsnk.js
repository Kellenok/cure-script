metaphorical road and an untranslatable word.</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは, and welcome to 令和三年 <em>(2021)</em>.</p><p>Under two years ago <em>(the video is from 2021)</em> the Reiwa era began <em>(2019)</em></p><p>with an upsurge of hope for a wonderful new era.</p><p>And then came Reiwa 2 <em>(2020)</em>, which quickly turned out</p><p>to be something of a disastrous year.</p><p>It was going to be the year of the Tokyo Olympics,</p><p>and we all know what happened to that.</p><p>But I still believe that Reiwa is going to be a wonderful new era</p><p>and perhaps 令和三年 will start to show us that.</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about two words</p><p>that I&#39;ve been asked about recently.</p><h2 id="通り" tabindex="-1">通り <a class="header-anchor" href="#通り" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;通り&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>The first is <code>通り</code> in its attachment to other words.</strong></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><code>通り</code> of course, on its own, is the い-stem of <code>通る</code> (pass through).</strong></p><p><strong>And as a noun, it means a road or a way, or the act of passing through.</strong></p><h3 id="その通り" tabindex="-1">その通り <a class="header-anchor" href="#その通り" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;その通り&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>It then gets used in expressions like <code>その通り</code></strong></p><p>and what this means literally is <strong><code>that road, or that way of travelling, that way of passing through</code></strong>.</p><p><strong>And what this actually means is <code>that&#39;s right / you&#39;re absolutely right</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>How does it come to mean that?</p><p><strong>Well, it&#39;s really saying that the way you&#39;re thinking,</strong></p><p><strong>the road, the track, the passage along which</strong></p><p><strong>you&#39;re thinking, is the correct one: <code>その通り</code>.</strong></p><p>A little bit similar in English to saying <code>you&#39;re on the right track</code>,</p><p>except that <code>you&#39;re on the right track</code> in English</p><p>would imply that you&#39;re not quite there yet,</p><p><strong>but <code>その通り</code> means you&#39;re thinking along exactly the right lines,</strong></p><p><strong>you&#39;re there, you&#39;ve got it, you&#39;re right.</strong></p><h3 id="ごらんの通り-ご覧の通り" tabindex="-1">ごらんの通り / ご覧の通り <a class="header-anchor" href="#ごらんの通り-ご覧の通り" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;ごらんの通り / ご覧の通り&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Another expression that uses <code>通り</code> is <code>ごらんの通り</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <code>ごらん</code> when it&#39;s written in kanji is written like this.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>御覧 is the full Kanji version of ごらん, even with the ご honorific in Kanji form, but overusing Kanji for everything is not that viable either, but it depends on the words and usage.</p></div><p>So <strong>you can see the <code>ご</code> is honorific;</strong></p><p><strong>the <code>覧</code> is actually another way of writing the word <code>見る</code>.</strong></p><p>Now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Kh1AJx77Ng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>I did a video</strong></a> a little while ago on the word <code>見る</code> (see or look or watch)</p><p>and five different kanji with which it can be written.</p><p><em>見る, 観る, 看る, 診る, 視る</em></p><p><strong>And I said at the time there are in fact more.</strong></p><p>I didn&#39;t introduce them because they&#39;re not all that common,</p><p>and this one <em>(覧る)</em> isn&#39;t a common way of writing <code>見る</code> either.</p><p>But with its on-reading <code>らん</code> it is used, and</p><p><strong><code>ごらん / ご覧</code> is an honorific way of saying <code>the act of looking or seeing</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>So <code>ご覧の通り</code>, rather like <code>その通り</code></strong>, means</p><p><strong><code>as you can see / along the lines of your seeing is correct</code>,</strong></p><p>just as along the lines of your saying or thinking is correct.</p><p><strong><code>ご覧の通り</code> (as you can see).</strong></p><h3 id="思い通り" tabindex="-1">思い通り <a class="header-anchor" href="#思い通り" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;思い通り&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Another <code>通り</code> expression is <code>おもいどおり / 思い通り</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <strong>here of course we&#39;re using the い-stem of <code>思う</code>,</strong></p><p>which gets translated as <code>think</code> in English</p><p><strong>but actually means more than that, it means <code>feel</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>But <code>思い</code> often also means one&#39;s will, one&#39;s desire,</strong></p><p>and I mentioned this in a previous video <em>(Lesson 42)</em></p><p>when I was explaining how <strong><code>思いのまま</code></strong> means</p><p><strong><code>in the unchanged condition of one&#39;s will or desire</code>.</strong></p><p>And I&#39;ll put a link for that in case you&#39;re interested in following it up.</p><p><strong><code>思い通り</code> means <code>in the road, the track, the course of one&#39;s will or desire</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>so it means having things go or wanting things to go in accordance</strong></p><p><strong>with one&#39;s will / in accordance with one&#39;s wishes.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And that can be anything from selfish desire to,</strong></p><p><strong>when you&#39;re in the water perhaps, wanting</strong></p><p><strong>your body to move in the way that you want it to move,</strong></p><p>which it doesn&#39;t always do when you&#39;re in the water.</p><h2 id="せっかく" tabindex="-1">せっかく <a class="header-anchor" href="#せっかく" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;せっかく&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Now, the other word that I&#39;ve been asked about is <code>せっかく</code>.</strong></p><p>Now, <code>せっかく</code> has a whole range of definitions</p><p>if you look in the dictionary.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>It&#39;s defined as &quot;with trouble, great pains; rare, valuable, precious,</strong></p><p><strong>long-awaited; kind, generous; specially, expressly&quot;,</strong></p><p>which is rather a lot of things for one word to mean.</p><p><strong>But essentially they all come down to the same thing,</strong></p><p><strong>which is the notion that something is valuable and in some sense irreplaceable.</strong></p><h3 id="せっかく-as-do-x-with-great-effort-trouble-and-is-too-precious-to-replace" tabindex="-1">せっかく as <code>do x with great effort / trouble and is too precious to replace</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#せっかく-as-do-x-with-great-effort-trouble-and-is-too-precious-to-replace" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;せっかく as &lt;code&gt;do x with great effort / trouble and is too precious to replace&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, <strong>probably the most common implication is</strong></p><p><strong>that great trouble has been spent on it.</strong></p><p>So if we say <code>せっかくの努力が水の泡だ</code>,</p><p><strong>we&#39;re saying <code>My <strong>せっかく</strong> efforts have come to nothing</code>,</strong></p><p>literally <code>...are foam on the water / bubbles on the water</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we can see that obviously as the most common usage,</p><p>the usage people probably think of most often,</p><p><strong>which is <code>with great effort / with great trouble / having taken the effort (to do something)</code>.</strong></p><hr><p>We might say <code><strong>せっかく</strong>東京に来た, we ought to go to Sanrio Puroland</code>,</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>because if you&#39;ve taken the trouble to go all the way to Tokyo,</strong></p><p><strong>it&#39;s a bit of a waste of time if you don&#39;t get to Sanrio Puroland</strong></p><p>and see Hello Kitty and My Melody and Pom Pom Purin</p><p>and all the wonderful people that live there, the Little Twin Stars.</p><p><strong>If you ever <code>せっかく</code> get to Tokyo, you really must go there.</strong></p><hr><p>But back to the subject in hand.</p><p><strong>However, the point about <code>せっかく</code> is not just</strong></p><p><strong>the trouble that might have been taken,</strong></p><p><strong>it is the fact that something is rare and precious and difficult to replace.</strong></p><p><strong>Going to Tokyo is difficult to replace because once you&#39;ve left</strong></p><p><strong>you&#39;ve got to take all the trouble to go back there again.</strong></p><p>But you might also say <code><strong>せっかく</strong>の休日も雨で潰れた</code></p><p>(The <strong><code>せっかく</code></strong> day of rest / holiday was ruined by rain).</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And that&#39;s <code>せっかく</code> because it&#39;s relatively rare.</strong></p><p><strong>You don&#39;t get that many days off.</strong></p><p>So just like going all the way to Tokyo or taking all those efforts to do something,</p><p><strong>it&#39;s <code>せっかく</code>, it&#39;s precious, it&#39;s rare, it&#39;s hard to replace.</strong></p><p><code>あの広告が<strong>せっかく</strong>の風景を損なう</code></p><p>(those advertisements / those billboards ruin the <strong><code>せっかく</code></strong> scenery).</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And again, <code>せっかく</code> in this case doesn&#39;t mean hard work,</strong></p><p><strong>it doesn&#39;t mean rarity in the sense of not coming very often,</strong></p><p><strong>it just means that that scenery is something beautiful and unique</strong></p><p><strong>and irreplaceable and it&#39;s being ruined by the billboards.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>And there isn&#39;t really a word to replace <code>せっかく</code> in English.</strong></p><p>It&#39;s a word that I would say is in some ways influenced by Japanese culture.</p><p><strong>The idea of the preciousness of the sakura</strong> <em>(tree)</em> because</p><p><strong>it only comes for a short time and it&#39;s quickly</strong></p><p><strong>blown away by the winds or beaten down by the rain.</strong></p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The sadness, the fleetingness, the <code>儚い</code> nature of life</p><p>and the necessity to grasp what is rare and precious</p><p>as it passes, while we can.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This hits quite differently when we realise Dolly passed away
