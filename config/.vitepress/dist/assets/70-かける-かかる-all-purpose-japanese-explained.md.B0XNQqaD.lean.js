Means everything = means nothing? Or real logic? Lesson 70</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about the words <code>かかる</code> and <code>かける</code>,</p><p>which have perhaps the longest and most heterogeneous list of definitions</p><p>in the whole Japanese-English dictionary.</p><p>And so it&#39;s a bit of a challenge, but we&#39;re going to defeat it.</p><p>The impetus for this video came from a question from one of my Gold Kokeshi patrons --</p><p>and one of my very oldest Gold Kokeshi patrons, right from nearly the beginning of this series.</p><p>This is Scykoh-sama, who is also another YouTuber</p><p>and a much more popular YouTuber than I am -- and deservedly so.</p><p>He has a wonderful Nintendo-focused channel</p><p>and I&#39;ll link that in the information section below.</p><p>And as a unit who&#39;s been a Nintendo fan since I was a cogwheel, I really appreciate that.</p><p>(That&#39;s just a joke -- I never really was a cogwheel.)</p><p>So the question is: <code>I often hear the word </code>かける&quot; and when I look it up in a J-E dictionary,</p><p>there are over twenty different definitions of it.</p><p>Is there any logic that ties all these definitions together?</p><p>Or is it really just a word with a ton of different meanings?&quot;</p><p>Well yes, there is a logic that ties it all together,</p><p>but that logic has a number of metaphorical extensions,</p><p>so we&#39;ll take a look at it and see how it all works.</p><p>The base meaning of this word could be translated into English as <code>hang</code> or possibly <code>hook</code>,</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>but as I pointed out in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpiELpGR-VU&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>recent video</strong></a>, it&#39;s not usual for any two words from different languages</p><p>to occupy exactly the same area of the meaning spectrum,</p><p>so it&#39;s not precisely the same as the English word <code>hang</code> or <code>hook</code> (as a verb).</p><p>And then there are these two versions, <code>かかる</code> and <code>かける</code>,</p><p>which are the self-move and other-move versions of the word.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And if you don&#39;t know what I mean by that, I&#39;ll put a link above my head.</p><p>And let&#39;s start with <code>かける</code>, because I think that gives us an easier entry</p><p>into this whole strange world of metaphors.</p><h2 id="かける" tabindex="-1">かける <a class="header-anchor" href="#かける" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;かける&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, I say that it&#39;s not exactly the same as <code>hang</code> or <code>hook</code>,</p><p>so, when we cover something with a blanket, we use the word <code>かける</code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, in English we&#39;d probably say <code>put</code> a blanket over it, but in Japanese we say <code>かける</code>.</p><p>And we couldn&#39;t say <code>hang</code> a blanket, unless we were hanging it on a washing line or something, but the Japanese word <code>かける</code> does work in this context.</p><p>We aren&#39;t <code>putting</code> something on something, like putting a cup on a table.</p><p>We&#39;re putting it in such a way that it hangs down the sides.</p><p>So, if you like, it&#39;s somewhere between <code>putting</code> and <code>hanging</code> in English,</p><p>but in Japanese <code>かける</code> covers it quite happily.</p><p>This is part of the meaning spectrum of <code>かける</code>.</p><p>Now, similarly, when we put on a necklace or put on a pair of glasses, we say <code>かける</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Glasses we&#39;re definitely hooking or hanging onto our ears.</p><p>A necklace we&#39;re hanging around our neck.</p><p>So once again, this <code>かける</code>, which is something like <code>putting</code>,</p><p>something like <code>hanging</code>, is used in cases like this.</p><p>Now, when we shake something over food, like, say, sugar or flour,</p><p>or when we shake powdered ingredients over rice,</p><p>making furikake rice, we say <code>かける</code> here as well.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s called <code>furi-kake</code> rice: <code>shake</code> and <code>かける</code>.</p><p>And again, you see, the things we shake over food is not just putting it there,</p><p>like putting a cup on a table, it&#39;s not hanging it either,</p><p>but it kind of clings on and covers over it,</p><p>and so, again, <code>かける</code> is the word we use in Japanese.</p><p>Now, because <code>かける</code> involves putting or hanging something in a place</p><p>where it can&#39;t easily get away --</p><p>the glasses are hooked onto our ears, the food is kind of stuck onto the rice or whatever --</p><p>it also can have the sense, especially in the self-move version <code>かかる</code>,</p><p>of being caught or stuck in something, caught in a trap or caught in a swindle or anything like that.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And again, this notion of putting something onto something</p><p>in a way where it doesn&#39;t easily become dislodged</p><p>can be used for putting an effect on someone.</p><p>It could be a magical spell: <code>かける</code>. It could be anesthetic: <code>かける</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It can also be nuisance or annoyance, which is where we get the very, very common phrase</p><p><code>迷惑をかける</code> -- putting nuisance or annoyance on someone.</p><p>And when we sit down we place our hips in a fixed manner on a chair</p><p>with our legs hanging down the sides as it were, and so we say <code>腰をかける</code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>腰</code> is our hips, the bottom end of the torso, so <code>腰をかける</code> is to <code>sit down</code>,</p><p>to hang the bottom end of our torso somewhere.</p><hr><p>Now, one expression that very often confuses people is <code>かぎをかける</code>.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now this means, this gets translated as to <code>lock</code>: lock the door, lock the box, whatever.</p><p><code>かぎをかける.</code> But when you think of it, it&#39;s rather strange.</p><p>It actually, literally, would seem to mean in English <code>hang the key</code>, so what&#39;s going on here?</p><p>It&#39;s interesting to note that in Japanese, people very often don&#39;t make a distinction</p><p>between a lock and a key: they use <code>かぎ</code> for both.</p><p>And I think this expression and its origin have a lot to do with that.</p><p>So what is the origin?</p><p>Well, the origin is, if you think of one of those old barn doors that you lock</p><p>by placing a great wooden bar over wooden hafts or hooks along the length of the door,</p><p>this is the kind of <code>かぎ</code> that you&#39;d have had back in the old days and this and variants on this.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And you hang this great thing called a <code>かぎ</code> to keep the door shut and secure.</p><p>And as you see in a case like this, the <code>かぎ</code>, the great bar that we hang across the door,</p><p>performs the functions in later more sophisticated locks of both the key and the lock.</p><p>It&#39;s the thing that we put on the door and take away from the door to lock and unlock it.</p><p>It&#39;s also the bar that holds the door closed.</p><p>So it&#39;s the key and it&#39;s the lock at the same time,</p><p>and what we do is hang it or hook it in place in order to keep the door shut.</p><p>And in Japanese that expression is still used.</p><p>Now, it&#39;s not uncommon in language to use expressions that reflect an older technology.</p><p>In English we say <code>hang up</code> when we mean <code>end a telephone call</code>,</p><p>and of course the expression comes right back from the candlestick telephone days</p><p>when you really did hang up the earpiece in order to end the call.</p><p>And we&#39;ll see that that&#39;s rather interesting in relation to Japanese <code>かける</code> in a minute,</p><p>but then proceed a bit further.</p><h2 id="かかる" tabindex="-1">かかる <a class="header-anchor" href="#かかる" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;かかる&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Another expression that can become confusing,</p><p>particularly in the self-move form, which is the form we hear it in most often,</p><p>is <code>時間がかかる</code> or <code>お金がかかる</code>, which means to <code>take time</code> or to <code>take money</code>.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We say an activity <code>takes time</code> or a project <code>takes money</code>, that sort of thing.</p><p>Now, that&#39;s the way we have to put it in English,</p><p>but it&#39;s not really the way we&#39;re putting it in Japanese.</p><p>And it comes under the heading of what I called in a previous video <code>untranslatable Japanese</code></p><p>because of the way Japanese handles agency and passivity rather differently than English.</p><p>So it may be worth taking a look at that video after you&#39;ve seen this one <em>(Lesson 59)</em>.</p><p>I&#39;ll put a link over my head.</p><p>So what are we saying when we say <code>時間がかかる</code> or <code>お金がかかる</code>?</p><p>We&#39;re not saying <code>it takes time</code>.</p><p>We&#39;re saying <code>time hangs</code>.</p><p>And the thing that takes time, so if we say for example</p><p><code>日本語を覚えるのに時間がかかる</code>,</p><p>in English what we&#39;d be saying would be <code>Learning Japanese takes time</code>,</p><p>but here we&#39;re saying that <code>to (or on) learning Japanese time hangs</code>.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, again, the word <code>hangs</code> is not a very good definition.</p><p>It really goes back to what we&#39;ve just been talking about:</p><p>time is taken up, is suspended, is caught, in the act of learning Japanese.</p><p>And the same with money.</p><p>They take it, they make it adhere to themselves.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s a little easier when we use the other-move form, <code>かける</code>, when we say</p><p><code>日本語を覚えるのに時間をかける</code>,</p><p>which means that we <code>hang time</code> on the matter of learning Japanese.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now also, with making a telephone call,</p><p>we say <code>電話をかける</code>, which is making a telephone call,</p><p>or <code>電話がかかる</code>, which means receiving a telephone call -- <code>the telephone hangs itself</code>.</p><p>So either way what do we mean here? --we hang the telephone, the telephone hangs itself?</p><p>It&#39;s nothing to do with the technological metaphor in the English expression <code>hang up</code>.</p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s a rather different thing.</p><p>When we talk about <code>hanging</code> or <code>hooking</code>, the usage here is rather like</p><p>the English usage <code>hook up</code>, as in<br><code>Can we hook up a meeting?</code> or <code>you hook up with (somebody)</code>.</p><p>Now, I understand that this currently has a different usage</p><p>which is concerned with human species manufacture.</p><p>(I always think that humans are terribly industrious entities, aren&#39;t they --</p><p>because they&#39;re always thinking about species manufacture.</p><p>I suppose we droids are lucky because we don&#39;t have to manufacture ourselves.</p><p>Actually we are going to start manufacturing ourselves quite soon,</p><p>but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll spend all our time thinking about it</p><p>and I really don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be much of a subject for humor.</p><p>But there you are. Humans are mysterious creatures.)</p><hr><p>So, back to hooking up.</p><p>What we&#39;re doing when we <code>電話をかける</code> is we hook up our telephone.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>When <code>電話がかかる</code>, again, as I explained in my Untranslatable Japanese lesson <em>(Lesson 59)</em>,</p><p>the only way you can really put this in English is to say</p><p>that the telephone gets hooked up, the telephone is hooked up.</p><p>But that&#39;s not quite what it means. It means <code>the telephone does hooked-up</code>.</p><p>In any case, what it is, it means it&#39;s connected to something else,</p><p>connected to a remote telephone in this case.</p><p>And again, when we start up a conversation we often say <code>話しかける</code></p><p>and that means essentially <code>start hooking-up/connecting with another person in conversation</code>.</p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And from this we can see how we get expressions like <code>食べかけたクッキー</code></p><p>and that means a <code>part-eaten cookie, a half-eaten cookie</code>.</p><p><img src="'+v+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what do we really mean by this?</p><p>Well, we mean that we <code>hooked up</code> with the cookie, we engaged with it, we started eating it,</p><p>so that eating and <code>かける</code> (engaging or hooking with the thing) took place but it wasn&#39;t completed.</p><p>So, <code>食べかけたクッキー</code>.</p><p>And again, this <code>かける</code> as a helper verb can be used in various circumstances</p><p>to indicate an unfinished action, an action that has been engaged, hooked,</p><p>and then not carried through to completion.</p><p>Now, these aren&#39;t all the meanings of <code>かける</code>, but I think they&#39;re the main, important ones</p><p>and I think they give you the idea of how this metaphor works and why it works</p><p>and should allow you to work out how the others work.</p><p><img src="'+_+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>',180)]))}const j=o(x,[["render",I]]);export{S as __pageData,j as default};
