I didn&#39;t talk about it too much at the time</p><p>because I think before you&#39;ve ingested the basics properly</p><p>it could be a bit complicated-feeling and hard to take in.</p><p>But now let&#39;s look at it properly.</p><h2 id="active-static-inert-words" tabindex="-1">Active &amp; Static/Inert words <a class="header-anchor" href="#active-static-inert-words" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Active &amp; Static/Inert words&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As you know, <strong>there are two kinds of word in Japanese</strong>,</p><p>and that is, <strong>active, changeable words and static</strong> <em>(inert)</em> <strong>words.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Active, changeable words consist of the three kinds of word that can make the engine of a sentence</strong>, that&#39;s to say, <strong>verbs, adjectives, and the copula</strong>.</p><p><strong>Static words are nearly all nouns, and they never change at all.</strong> They can&#39;t change in any way.</p><hr><p>Now, <strong>all the words that can change change in exactly the same way</strong>.</p><p>We have to know two things about them.</p><p><strong>The first is that nothing changes in the base form of a word except the last kana</strong>.</p><p>That&#39;s the う-row kana in a verb or the い in an adjective.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Nothing before that can change.</strong></p><p>That&#39;s as fixed and settled and inert as a noun.</p><p>It&#39;s only that last kana that can ever change</p><p><strong>and that can then have things attached to it.</strong></p><p><strong>The second thing to know is that they all change according to the stem-helper system.</strong></p><p>So, although I introduced the て-form as if it was a <code>form</code>,</p><p>a kind of morphing or conjugation of the whole word,</p><p><strong>it is in fact a stem-helper system of its own.</strong></p><p><strong>In real Japanese grammar as taught to Japanese natives by Japanese natives,</strong></p><p><strong>-た and -て are regarded as helpers, as entities in themselves that attach to the stem of a word.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So essentially <strong>verbs have not one stem-system, but two stem-systems.</strong></p><p>And that&#39;s partly why I didn&#39;t introduce it straight away, because that feels a bit overwhelming at first.</p><h2 id="the-て-stem-system" tabindex="-1">The て-stem system <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-て-stem-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The て-stem system&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The second stem-system, that&#39;s the て-stem, you already know.
