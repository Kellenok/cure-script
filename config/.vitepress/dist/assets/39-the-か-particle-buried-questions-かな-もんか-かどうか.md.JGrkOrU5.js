much more</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about questions that aren&#39;t questions.</p><p>They come up all the time in Japanese, so it&#39;s important to understand what they are</p><p>and how they work.</p><p>So, what we&#39;re going to talk about is the particle -か.</p><p>Now, we probably know the particle -か as a kind of verbal question mark</p><p>that goes at the end of です/ます sentences to turn them into questions.</p><p>However, we don&#39;t use -か, as we explained last week,</p><p>at the end of sentences to mark them as questions in regular, non-formal Japanese.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>Because putting -か at the end of a non-formal sentence sounds kind of blunt and rough.</p><p>It&#39;s not ungrammatical, and it&#39;s sometimes used by male speakers who want to sound blunt or rough.</p><p>But generally speaking, we don&#39;t use it.</p><p>We indicate questions by intonation in regular speech.</p><p>But we do use the -か marker all the time, just not at the end of sentences.</p><p>What do we use it for?</p><p>Well, we use it to mark questions, but not quite what we normally think of when we say <code>question</code>.</p><p>So let&#39;s start right off with an example.</p><p>Suppose we say, <code>さくらが来るかわからない.</code></p><p>What we&#39;re saying is <code>I don&#39;t know if Sakura will come.</code></p><p>And what&#39;s literally happening here is that we&#39;re turning the logical sentence, the proposition, <code>さくらが来る</code>, which means <code>Sakura will come</code>, into a question, and then we&#39;re saying <code>わからない.</code></p><p>So we&#39;re essentially saying <code>Sakura come (question), not clear / The question of whether Sakura will come is not clear to me.</code></p><p>In English, <code>I don&#39;t know if Sakura&#39;s coming.</code></p><p>Now, we can use this as part of an actual question.</p><p>We might say <code>さくらが来るか知っていますか.</code></p><p>Now, if we ask that in です/ます form, as I just did, we use a second -か at the end</p><p>to mark the actual question.</p><p>So we&#39;re saying <code>The question of whether Sakura will come, do you know?</code></p><p>And we should notice here that what&#39;s happening is, first of all, the -か is turning the proposition, the question, into something noun-like which we can then use as the basis of a new sentence.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So that&#39;s the first thing we need to notice, and the second thing we need to notice is</p><p>that -か displaces logical particles most of the time.</p><p>So, normally when we say <code>わからない</code>, we say <code>(何-何)がわからない</code>;</p><p>if we say <code>知ってる</code>, we say <code>(何-何)を知ってる</code>; but in this case</p><p>the -か particle displaces the normal logical particle.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we say <code>さくらが来るかわからない</code> not <code>さくらが来るかがわからない.</code></p><p>So <code>さくらが来るか</code> is a noun-like entity which, because it ends in -か, doesn&#39;t need</p><p>to take the usual logical particle.</p><h2 id="かどうか" tabindex="-1">かどうか <a class="header-anchor" href="#かどうか" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;かどうか&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, it also gets used in the common expression <code>かどうか</code>.</p><p>And although we can learn this as a glued-together expression meaning <code>whether or not</code>,</p><p>so <code>さくらが来るかどうかわからない</code> means <code>I don&#39;t know whether Sakura&#39;s coming or not,</code></p><p>(in English that&#39;s how we&#39;d say it, as opposed to <code>さくらが来るかわからない</code> --</p><p>in English we&#39;d say <code>I don&#39;t know if Sakura&#39;s coming</code>;<br><code>さくらが来るかどうかわからない</code> – we&#39;d say in English <code>I don&#39;t know whether Sakura&#39;s coming or not.</code>)</p><p>what we&#39;re literally saying here is <code>Sakura coming (question) how (question) わからない.</code></p><p>So what we&#39;re saying is something like <code>I don&#39;t know if Sakura&#39;s coming or how it will be.</code></p><p>And from this we can see how we get the use of -か to mean <code>or</code> between nouns.</p><p>So we can say <code>お茶かコーヒーどちらがいい?</code></p><p>-- <code>Tea or coffee, which would you like?</code></p><p>Now, how is this working?</p><p>Well, essentially this is an abbreviation of <code>お茶かコーヒーかどちらがいい?</code></p><p>So, we&#39;re putting two propositions side by side, <code>whether coffee or whether tea,</code> and</p><p>then asking <code>どちらがいい?</code></p><p>And once again although this seems like a different use, -か is doing the same thing</p><p>-- it&#39;s bundling something up as a proposition.</p><p>But remember that when we use <code>or</code> in English it&#39;s always got to be a question.</p><p>It&#39;s never a certainty.</p><p>If we say <code>A or B</code> we&#39;re saying it might be A and it might be B.</p><p>If we say <code>A and B</code>, we know what we&#39;re talking about.</p><p>We know that both A and B exist or do whatever it is that we&#39;re saying.</p><p>But if we say <code>A or B</code>, we don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s A or whether it&#39;s B.</p><p>We know it&#39;s one of them.</p><p>So, again this -か, this questioning-whether particle, is continuing to use that function</p><p>of marking a possibility, a question, something that might happen or might not happen,</p><p>might be there or might not be there.</p><h2 id="かも知れない" tabindex="-1">かも知れない <a class="header-anchor" href="#かも知れない" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;かも知れない&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, we see this at work, for example, in <code>かも知れない</code>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, this is taught as if it were a word or expression that means <code>maybe</code>.</p><p>And it is, but teaching it as a lump like that, as I&#39;ve explained in another video, is misleading.</p><p>The point of that misleadingness that I would like to talk about here is that</p><p>it confuses us about what that -か is actually doing.</p><p>That -か is attached to the proposition that we are talking about.</p><p>So, if we say <code>さくらが来るかも知れない</code> -- <code>Perhaps Sakura will come</code> --</p><p>what we&#39;re saying is <code>さくらが来るか</code>, that&#39;s the question or proposition</p><p>that we&#39;re talking about, and then <code>も知れない.</code></p><p>The も is giving us the meaning of <code>even</code> or <code>as much as</code>, as I&#39;ve explained that it very often does,</p><p>and <code>知れない</code> is <code>知る</code> -- <code>know</code> / <code>知れる</code>-- <code>ability to know or be known</code></p><p>and the helper adjective <code>-ない</code>.</p><p>So the whole thing actually means <code>さくらが来るか</code> -- <code>the question of whether Sakura comes</code> – <code>も知れない</code> -- <code>I can&#39;t go so far as to know / Maybe Sakura will come, maybe she won&#39;t.</code></p><h2 id="かな" tabindex="-1">かな <a class="header-anchor" href="#かな" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;かな&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Similarly with <code>かな</code>, which is sometimes presented as a particle meaning <code>I wonder</code>,</p><p>you see how this actually works.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>in the video, there is a typo where the red line says が instead of か. I fixed it.</p></div><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>か</code> is taking the proposition, so if we say <code>さくらが来るかな</code>, we&#39;re saying</p><p><code>さくらが来るか</code> -- <code>the question of whether Sakura will come</code> -- <code>な</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>な</code>, as we&#39;ve discussed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWEok4Ivfyc&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>another video</strong></a>, is a marker that indicates addressing something to yourself.</p><p>So, you&#39;re saying <code>Will Sakura come?</code> addressing that to yourself.</p><p>The way we would say that in English is &quot;I wonder if Sakura will come / I am pondering</p><p>the question of whether Sakura will come.&quot;</p><p>And while it&#39;s all right to learn things like <code>かな</code> and <code>かも知れない</code> as if they were</p><p>what the textbooks say they are, lumps of grammar that you just have to memorize,</p><p>it helps not only with those but with structure as a whole to understand what they&#39;re really doing.</p><p>They&#39;re bundling something into a question, so a proposition becomes a question which</p><p>is a noun-like entity which we can then add something like &quot;do you know / I don&#39;t know /</p><p>I can&#39;t be sure<code> or </code>I wonder (I&#39;m addressing this question to myself).&quot;</p><p>Now, from this proposition-making quality and questioning quality of -か, we get expressions</p><p>such as one which we discussed in a previous video, <code>まるでゆうれいを見たかのような顔.</code></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, that means <code>a face as if one had seen a ghost.</code></p><p>So what&#39;s the -か doing here?</p><p>It&#39;s doing the same thing as before.</p><p>It&#39;s marking <code>ゆうれいを見た</code> as a question, a proposition, a thing that&#39;s not certain,</p><p>in fact in this particular case, a thing that hasn&#39;t happened: we&#39;re not saying that</p><p>the person HAS seen a ghost, we&#39;re only saying that she had a face AS IF she had seen a ghost.</p><p>So we&#39;re marking the proposition that she&#39;d seen a ghost as a question and then continuing to comment on it, and in this case we actually are attaching a logical particle,</p><p>the logical particle の, to the か-marked noun-like entity that we have made of the proposition that she is seeing a ghost.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So with a の-particle, unlike the が and を-particle, we can attach this to a か-marked entity.</p><p>Now, there is another use of -か, which is a little different but still closely related</p><p>to its question-making quality.</p><h2 id="もんか-ものか" tabindex="-1">もんか/ものか <a class="header-anchor" href="#もんか-ものか" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;もんか/ものか&quot;">​</a></h2><p>And that is in certain expressions where it negativizes what we&#39;re talking about.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>An example of this that you&#39;ve probably come across if you&#39;ve been watching anime or reading manga is <code>もんか</code>.</p><p>And that&#39;s short for <code>ものか</code>, and it can be used in more formal speech,</p><p>in which case we say <code>ものですか</code>.</p><p>So, if I were to say <code>そちらへ行くものですか,</code> I&#39;m saying <code>I won&#39;t go there / I&#39;m not going there.</code></p><p>If I say <code>さくらが来るものですか,</code> I&#39;m saying &quot;Sakura is not coming / She won&#39;t come /</p><p>There&#39;s no likelihood of her coming.&quot;</p><p>What does <code>ものですか</code> mean?</p><p>It means literally <code>Is that a thing?</code></p><p>So, it&#39;s a question, but it&#39;s the kind of negativizing question that we also get in English</p><p>when we say things like <code>Do you think I&#39;m going to do that?</code> or <code>Would I do that?</code> or <code>How likely is that?</code></p><p>In all those cases, by turning something into a question we&#39;re denying its likelihood.</p><p>Now, when we say <code>ものか</code> it&#39;s the same thing, and it often gets reduced right down to <code>もんか</code>.</p><p>So someone might say <code>それを食べるもんか</code> -- <code>I&#39;m not eating that.</code></p><p>And you notice here that we are in fact using the か marker after a regular non-formal sentence, and that&#39;s because <code>もんか</code> or <code>ものか</code> is in fact rather a rough way of talking.</p><p>You&#39;re denying something very forcefully and often in opposition to somebody.</p><h2 id="どころか" tabindex="-1">どころか <a class="header-anchor" href="#どころか" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;どころか&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Another place where we often see -か as a negativizing question marker is in <code>どころか</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>どころ</code> is a form of <code>ところ</code>,<br> which we talked about in a recent lesson, didn&#39;t we? <em>(Lesson 36)</em></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>ところ</code> can mean not just <code>place</code> in the literal sense, but a time or a circumstance or condition.</p><p>When it&#39;s said as <code>どころ</code> it&#39;s usually negative, so when we say <code>どころか</code>, we&#39;re negativizing what came before it and usually putting an even stronger negative after it.</p><p>So if we say, for example, <code>漢字が読めるどころかひらがなも読めない</code> --</p><p><code>Not only can&#39;t I read kanji, I can&#39;t even read hiragana.</code></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>What&#39;s <code>どころか</code> doing here?</p><p>Well, of course it&#39;s negativizing, just as we&#39;ve already seen that it can, but it&#39;s also</p><p>using the concept of place / <code>ところ</code>, that&#39;s to say, conceptual space rather than literal place.</p><p>We&#39;re saying <code>Not only can&#39;t I go as far as reading kanji, I can&#39;t even get to the point of reading hiragana.</code></p><p>That&#39;s the metaphor that&#39;s being used here: not only has the situation not reached this far place, it hasn&#39;t even reached a nearer place than that.</p><p>So we see that while -か has a variety of meanings, all of them are closely connected</p><p>to its ability to make a question and turn the question into a proposition,</p><p>but never a proposition that exists in actuality, always a hypothetical condition…</p>',151),m=[w];function y(f,k,b,q,_,S){return o(),t("div",null,m)}const x=e(g,[["render",y]]);export{v as __pageData,x as default};
