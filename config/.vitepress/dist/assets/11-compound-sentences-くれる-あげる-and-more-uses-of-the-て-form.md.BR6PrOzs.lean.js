We&#39;ve learned enough now that we can start looking at some real narrative. It&#39;ll be a little simplified at first, but we can use this to bring together the things we&#39;ve learned so far. We&#39;ll also be learning new structural elements because even in the simplest story we&#39;re going to encounter things that we need to learn. But this may be a more interesting way of doing it. So please let me know what you think in the comments below. All right.</p><p>Now let&#39;s go into a story that I believe we all know.</p><p><code>ある日アリスは川のそばにいた.</code></p><p>Now, this is a simple sentence. The word <code>川/かわ</code> means <code>river</code>, and <strong><code>そば</code> means <code>beside</code> and it&#39;s a noun.</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So <code>川のそば</code> is <code>the beside of the river</code>. Just as we put something on the <code>on</code> of the table or the <code>under</code> of the table and <strong>we also always mark it with に</strong>, so the <code>beside of the river</code> is where Alice was.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>ある</code> means <code>a certain</code>, so <code>ある日</code> is like <code>one day</code> or <code>a certain day</code>, and let&#39;s notice that what&#39;s happening here is what we&#39;ve seen before. <strong><code>ある</code> is the verb that means <code>exist</code> or <code>be</code></strong>, and what we&#39;ve done here is what we&#39;ve seen in the video lesson on so-called adjectives. <em>(Lesson 6)</em> <strong>We can make any engine into an adjective.</strong> So, <strong><code>ある</code> is an <code>A does B</code> engine, an う-engine</strong>, so if we say <code>本がある</code> we are saying, <code>There is a book / a book exists</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And if we move that <code>ある</code> engine to the other side of the book, we turn it white and it becomes a descriptor, an adjectival.</strong> So we&#39;re saying <code>ある本</code> – <code>an existing book / a certain book / a book that there is</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And it&#39;s the same: <code>ある日</code> – <code>a certain day</code>.</p><p><code>ある日アリスは川のそばにいた</code></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, the next sentence is going to be a little bit more complex, but don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s always easy when there&#39;s a fully-functioning android to help you. (Actually, I&#39;m not quite fully-functioning, but for the purposes of showing you Japanese I am.)</p><p><code>おねえちゃんはつまらない本をよんでいてあそんでくれなかった</code></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we&#39;ve got quite a complex sentence here, and let&#39;s break it down. <code>おねえちゃん</code> means <code>big sister</code>: <code>ねえ</code> is <code>sister</code>; <code>-ちゃん</code>, I&#39;m sure you know, is a cute, friendly honorific; <code>お-</code> is also an honorific. So, <code>おねえちゃん</code> – <code>big sister</code>.</p><p><code>つまらない</code> means <code>dull</code> or <code>boring</code>. <code>本</code>, as we know, is <code>book</code>. <code>よむ</code> means <code>read</code>; <code>よんでいる</code> – we <strong>put the <code>よむ</code> into the て-form and add <code>いる</code></strong> and it means <code>is reading</code>; and then we put the <code>いる</code> itself into the て-form.</p><p>So why are we doing all that? Let&#39;s take a look. <code>おねえちゃんはつまらない本をよんでいて</code> – <code>Big sister is reading a boring book</code>– but then that -て.... <strong>て-form has a lot of different uses.</strong> <strong>In this case it will complete a clause.</strong> <code>Big sister is reading a boring book</code> – that&#39;s a complete clause, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And if we turn that final う-engine into the て-form, what we&#39;re saying is that something else is going to follow this clause.</strong> <strong>We are indicating that we&#39;re making a complex sentence made up of more than one clause.</strong> So it&#39;s like saying, <code>Big sister was reading a boring book **and...**</code> And that something else comes: <code>あそんでくれなかった</code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>あそぶ</code> means to <code>play</code>, and that also is in the て-form, isn&#39;t it? <code>あそぶ</code> --&gt; あそんで&quot;. If you&#39;re in any doubt of how we make these て-forms, please go back to the video lesson on the て-form and refresh your memory. <em>(Lesson 5)</em></p><p><code>あそんでくれなかった</code></p><p>Now this is another use of the て-form. <strong>て-form is terribly important and it does various different things.</strong> What&#39;s it doing here? Well, <code>あそぶ</code>, as we know, means <code>play</code>.</p><p><code>くれる</code> means to <code>give</code>, <strong>and it specifically means <code>give downwards</code></strong>. And the reason we say <code>give downwards</code> in Japanese is because we are always polite to people. <strong>So we always represent ourselves as being below other people and other people as being above ourselves.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So <strong>if I say <code>くれる</code> (give), I always mean that someone is giving something to me or to someone close to me.</strong></p><p>But what is Alice&#39;s big sister giving – or not giving – to Alice?</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Well, it&#39;s not the book. In fact, it&#39;s not any actual object. <strong>She is giving the action to which <code>くれる</code> is connected by the て-form.</strong> She is giving – or in this case, not giving – the act of playing to Alice.</p><p>What do we mean by that? <strong>Well, we say <code>くれる</code> not only for giving a thing – a book, a present, a candy – we also say it for giving an action, for doing something for our benefit.</strong> <strong>This is very very often used in Japanese, so it&#39;s important to understand it.</strong> If someone does something for our benefit, we turn that action to て-form and we add <code>くれる</code>. <strong>If we do something for someone else&#39;s benefit, we turn that action into te-form and add <code>あげる</code>, which means to <code>give upward</code>, in other words, to give to you, to give to another person.</strong></p><p><code>くれる</code> and <code>あげる</code> – give down to me or my group / [<code>**あげる**</code>] <strong>give up to you or someone else or your group or their group.</strong></p><p>So what is this second part of the sentence? It&#39;s <code>あそんでくれなかった</code> – &quot;she didn&#39;t play / she didn&#39;t give Alice playing-with / she didn&#39;t play for Alice&#39;s benefit&quot;.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s rather different from anything we find in English, but it&#39;s also very expressive, something we could actually do with having in English.</p><p>So now let&#39;s look at the whole sentence again. <code>おねえちゃんはつまらない本をよんでいてあそんでくれなかった</code> – <code>Big sister was reading a boring book and did not play \\[with Alice\\]</code>.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Notice that <strong>we have two complete clauses here</strong>: <em>Clause 1:</em> <code>おねえちゃんはつまらない本をよんだ</code> – that&#39;s a complete clause in itself, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><em>Clause 2:</em> <code>おねえちゃんはあそんでくれなかった</code> – <code>Oneechan did not play for Alice&#39;s benefit</code></p><p><strong>And we&#39;ve connected the two together with the て-form.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>A thing we should notice here is that <code>おねえちゃんはつまらない本をよんで</code> doesn&#39;t tell us the tense.</strong> <strong>We don&#39;t know whether she&#39;s reading a boring book right now or in the future or in the past. We don&#39;t know that until we get to the end of the sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In English we put the tense marker on both halves of a complex sentence. We would say, <code>Big sister WAS reading a boring book...</code> so we already know that it&#39;s in the past. <strong>But in Japanese we put that tense marker, -た or -かった, at the end and we only need one tense marker per sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>よんでいて</code> could mean <code>is reading</code> or could mean <code>was reading</code>, <strong>but because the <code>あそんでくれなかった</code> is in the past and it&#39;s part of the same sentence we have put everything into the past.</strong></p><p>Well, we didn&#39;t get very far into Alice&#39;s adventure today, did we? But we can proceed faster as we get used to real text and learn the basic narrative structures.</p>',51)]))}const I=o(y,[["render",v]]);export{x as __pageData,I as default};
