Limits! 限る Kagiru 限り Kagiri - Its many meanings and how they work 知っている限り、とは限らない and more</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about <code>限る</code> and <code>限り</code>.</p><p><strong><code>限る</code> is a verb meaning <code>limit</code> or <code>restrict</code>,</strong></p><p>and <strong><code>限り</code> is the い-stem, therefore the noun-form of that verb.</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If you don&#39;t know about い-stems making noun-forms,</p><p>I&#39;ll link a video above my head which tells you all the secrets of the mysterious い-stem.<br><em>(Lesson 72)</em></p><p>Now, <strong>Japanese likes limiting expressions, expressions to do with limits and boundaries.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56sy0qfY0Js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>I did a video</strong></a> on <code>うち</code> <em>(Lesson 97)</em> a little while ago<br> and I&#39;ll put a link above my head and in the information section below.</p><p><code>うち</code> concentrates on the enclosure, on the area that we&#39;re in</p><p>and everything else is outside of.</p><p><strong><code>限り</code>, on the other hand, concentrates on the boundaries of that enclosure,</strong></p><p><strong>the edges beyond which the enclosure does not reach.</strong></p><p>And this gives rise to a whole range of expression strategies,</p><p>some of which are quite literal, others of which are very metaphorical</p><p>and can confuse people if they don&#39;t understand where they&#39;re coming from.</p><h2 id="限る" tabindex="-1">限る <a class="header-anchor" href="#限る" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;限る&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>So, let&#39;s start with a very simple use of <code>限る</code>.</strong></p><p><code>出席は招待者に<strong>限る</strong></code></p><p><strong><code>出席</code> is attendance at whatever the event may be.</strong></p><p><strong>It is limited at <code>招待者</code> (invited persons).</strong></p><p><strong>Outside that limit, <code>出席</code> doesn&#39;t exist.</strong></p><p><strong>You can&#39;t attend the meeting or whatever unless you are an invited person.</strong></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, another mainly literal use is <code>声の<strong>限りに</strong>呼んだ</code> (I called <strong>at the limit</strong> of my voice).</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"><br> In English we might say <code>the top of my voice</code>.</p><p><strong>What we&#39;re saying here is the limit as loud as my voice would go.</strong></p><p>So these are quite literal and easy to understand.</p><p>But then we get expressions which I think most of you will have heard</p><p>at some time and are perhaps a little more confusing.</p><p>So, <code>夏はアイスクリイムに<strong>限る</strong></code> -- now, loosely in English that means</p><p><code>In summer, ice cream <strong>is the best thing</strong></code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>What we&#39;re actually saying is<br><code>Speaking of summer, when it comes to summer, it <strong>reaches its limit</strong> at ice cream</code>,</p><p>in other words, ice cream <strong>is the furthest you can take</strong> summer /</p><p>ice cream <strong>is the pinnacle of</strong> summer /<br><strong>there&#39;s nothing beyond</strong> ice cream when we&#39;re talking about summer.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Of course, this is just a natural Eng translation, hence why it is hard to pin-point 限る here.</p></div><hr><p>And this can be used in all kinds of different expressions, for example:</p><p><code>運動なら水泳に<strong>限る</strong></code><br> (if it&#39;s exercise / if we&#39;re talking about exercise, it <strong>reaches its limit</strong> with swimming [<code>水泳</code>] /</p><p>swimming <strong>is absolutely the best kind of</strong> exercise).</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And moving on from this we get expressions like <code>彼女に<strong>限って</strong>そんなことはしない</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And again, in loose English this would be<br> &quot;She <strong>of all people</strong> wouldn&#39;t do such a thing</p><p>/ she&#39;d be <strong>the last person</strong> to do such a thing&quot;.</p><p>What we&#39;re actually saying is</p><p><code>She is <strong>the very limit of</strong> people who wouldn&#39;t do such a thing</code>.</p><hr><p>So just like ice cream being <strong>the best thing</strong> in summer<br> or calling <strong>at the very maximum extent</strong> of your voice,<br> she is <strong>the maximum, the extreme</strong> of people who wouldn&#39;t do such a thing.</p><p><strong>Other people might possibly do it, even if you&#39;d think they wouldn&#39;t,</strong></p><p><strong>but she is the very limit of the kind of person who wouldn&#39;t do that kind of thing.</strong></p><h2 id="限る-used-negatively-not-limited-to-x" tabindex="-1">限る used negatively (not limited to x) <a class="header-anchor" href="#限る-used-negatively-not-limited-to-x" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;限る used negatively (not limited to x)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, <strong>the concept of <code>限る</code> (limit) is often used negatively to show that</strong></p><p><strong>something is not limited to a particular statement, a particular notion.</strong></p><p>So, <code>辞書に書いてあることが常に正しいとは限らない</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And this <code>-とは限らない</code> essentially sums up the previous statement</strong></p><p>and says that&#39;s <strong>not limited to being the case.</strong></p><p>So what we&#39;re saying here is <code>Things that are written in a dictionary are always correct</code> --</p><p><strong>that&#39;s the statement, then we quote that <code>-とは限らない</code>:</strong></p><p><code><strong>It&#39;s not necessarily the case that</strong> things written in a dictionary are always correct.</code></p><p>And I think we found that out to be true on various occasions.</p><h2 id="限り" tabindex="-1">限り <a class="header-anchor" href="#限り" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;限り&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, again, this <code>限り</code> can be used for the limits of one&#39;s knowledge and very often is,</p><p>so <code>私の知っている<strong>限り</strong>ではそんな言葉はない</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, in English we would say <code>As far as I know, there&#39;s no such word</code>,<br> but the expression strategy here is to modify the noun <code>限り</code> -- <code>私の知っている<strong>限り</strong></code></p><p>(<strong>the limit of</strong> what I know): <code><strong>Up to the limit of</strong> what I know, there is no such word.</code></p><p>And actually in this case it&#39;s pretty similar to the English:</p><p><code><strong>as far as</strong> I know / <strong>to the limit of</strong> what I know</code>.</p><p>And it&#39;s interesting here that <strong>while English says</strong> <code><strong>as far as</strong> I know</code>,</p><p><strong>Japanese achieves the same broad pattern by modifying the noun <code>限り</code> (limit).</strong></p><p>And as we talked about last week <em>(Lesson 90)</em>,<br><strong>modification does an awful lot of the heavy lifting in Japanese</strong></p><p><strong>that&#39;s done by other strategies in English.</strong></p><hr><p>Now, another common expression which can be a bit confusing is the kind of expression</p><p>we find in <code>急いでいる時に<strong>限って</strong>バスが遅れる</code></p><p>(<strong>limited to</strong> times when we are in a hurry, the bus comes late).</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, <strong>this is obviously not literal, but it expresses a sentiment often felt,</strong></p><p><strong>that the bus or whatever it is that does something we don&#39;t want it to do does it</strong></p><p><strong>specifically when we very much don&#39;t want or can&#39;t afford it to do it.</strong></p><p>So really that expression that can seem a little bit confusing at first is a very natural</p><p>kind of expression which I think you do find in English sometimes.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s only when we really need it that it doesn&#39;t happen.</strong></p><h3 id="その場限り" tabindex="-1">その場限り <a class="header-anchor" href="#その場限り" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;その場限り&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, another expression is <code>その場限り</code>.</p><p>So, <code>その場限りことを言う</code> means<br> she says things <strong>on the spur of the moment</strong> / she talks right off the top of her head.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><code>その場</code></strong>, which we&#39;ve discussed in another video, which I&#39;ll link <em>(Lesson 75)</em>, means literally</p><p><strong><code>that place / the appropriate place / the place one would happen to be at at the time</code></strong>, but</p><p><strong>of course in Japanese as in other languages, place can also mean a time or an occasion.</strong></p><hr><p>So, <code><strong>その場限り</strong>ことを言う</code> means<br> she says things that <strong>just arise out of the particular occasion and nothing else</strong> --<br><strong>limited to that particular occasion / having no real relevance outside that particular occasion.</strong></p><p>So the implication is just essentially talking stuff of no real value that</p><p>comes off the top of her head.</p><h3 id="その場限りさ" tabindex="-1">その場限りさ <a class="header-anchor" href="#その場限りさ" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;その場限りさ&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And a very common expression related to this is <code>喧嘩はその場限りさ</code> – ケンカ</p><p>and <strong>this is a popular expression, it&#39;s not exactly a full sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>I used Kanji form for ケンカ (喧嘩), but both are fine.</p></div><p><strong>The <code>さ</code> is rather making it into a <code>should</code>.</strong></p><p><strong><code>さ</code> here is saying <code>that&#39;s how it ought to be / come on, that&#39;s how it should be</code>.</strong></p><p>And it&#39;s translated into English as <code>quarrels should not be continued</code>.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Sometimes it&#39;s even translated as <code>let not the sun settle on your wrath</code>,</p><p>which of course is nothing to do with what it&#39;s really saying.</p><p><strong>But the point here is that quarrels should be limited to <code>その場</code></strong></p><p><strong>(the occasion, the event on which they arise).</strong></p><p><strong>So if you quarrel with someone today you shouldn&#39;t be carrying on that quarrel tomorrow.</strong></p><p>Very good advice.</p><p>So this is a range of the circumstances in which the <code>限り / 限る</code> concept</p><p>is applied in Japanese.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>There are others, of course, but with this information</p><p>I think you&#39;ll be in a better position to see what&#39;s going on.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The links
