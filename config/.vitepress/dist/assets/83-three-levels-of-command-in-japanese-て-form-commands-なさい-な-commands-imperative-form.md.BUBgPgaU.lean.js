Lesson 83</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about</p><p>ways of making commands and requests in Japanese.</p><p>You&#39;ll probably know some of these already,</p><p>but I think we&#39;re going to go a little bit deeper</p><p>to some things you may not have realized.</p><p><strong>We&#39;re going to go from the least commanding and intense towards the most</strong>,</p><p>so we&#39;ll start off with one that we all know, which is the て-form.</p><h2 id="the-て-form" tabindex="-1">The て-form <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-て-form" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The て-form&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Some sources will tell you that the て-form on its own is a command or request form.</p><p><strong>That&#39;s only half true. It&#39;s the abbreviation of a command or request.</strong></p><p>If we say <code>ちょっと待って</code> (wait a little), <strong>this is an abbreviation</strong></p><p>of <code>ちょっと待ってください</code> (wait a little please)</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>and probably because of this<br> it&#39;s the one that&#39;s least likely to be offensive, although <strong>it&#39;s still casual.</strong></p><p>Now, sometimes you&#39;ll hear people saying not <code>ちょっと待って</code></p><p>but <code>ちょっと待って<strong>て</strong></code>. What&#39;s going on here?</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Essentially what they&#39;re saying is <code><strong>Wait a little bit and I&#39;ll be back</strong></code>.</p><p><strong>The implication is that the waiting period will end fairly shortly.</strong></p><p>And what this actually is is a contraction of <code>ちょっと待って<strong>いて</strong></code>.</p><p>As we know <code>待っている</code> means <code>exist in a state of waiting</code>, <code>be waiting</code>, in English.</p><p><strong>So <code>ちょっと待ってて</code> is actually taking this <code>待っている</code> and putting it into て-form</strong>,</p><p><strong>so that what you&#39;re being asked or instructed to do is exist in a state of waiting.</strong></p><p>And the implication of this is, <strong>just exist for a little bit in a state of waiting.</strong></p><p><strong>And of course this doesn&#39;t have to be waiting, it can be anything,</strong></p><p><strong>but the implication is, just do it for a bit, just exist in that state for a short time.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>If we don&#39;t say <code>ちょっと</code></strong> (and we don&#39;t necessarily)</p><p><strong>there&#39;s nothing to indicate a short time, but that is always the implication</strong></p><p><strong>of telling someone with the て-form to exist in a particular state.</strong></p><h3 id="て-form-with-ない-helper-adjective" tabindex="-1">て-form with ない helper adjective <a class="header-anchor" href="#て-form-with-ない-helper-adjective" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;て-form with ない helper adjective&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The other thing to know about the て-form which is used to tell or ask someone</p><p>to do something is that, as we know, <strong>the equivalent negative adjective of any verb</strong></p><p><strong>is made by simply attaching the helper adjective <code>ない</code> to the あ-stem.</strong></p><p><strong>And the helper adjective <code>ない</code> actually is unusual in that it has two て-forms.</strong></p><p>It has the regular て-form, which is formed just like any other て-form,</p><p>by attaching -て to the く-stem, so that&#39;s <code>なくて</code>,</p><p><strong>but it also has the irregular て-form <code>ないで</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And when attached to a verb this is only used in two kinds of circumstance.</p><h4 id="ないで-irregular-て-form-of-ない" tabindex="-1">ないで -

the abbreviation of なさい <a class="header-anchor" href="#な-the-abbreviation-of-なさい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;な - the abbreviation of なさい&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Something that can be confusing here is that there is an abbreviation of <code>なさい</code></strong></p><p><strong>which can be confused with a different abbreviation meaning the opposite.</strong></p><p><strong>And that abbreviation is <code>な</code>.</strong></p><p>When we attach <code>な</code> <strong>to the い-stem of a verb</strong>, then we&#39;re actually abbreviating <code>なさい</code>.</p><p><strong>So if we say <code>準備しな</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>準備しなさい</code> (get ready, get prepared)</strong>:</p><p><code>準備する</code>, い-stem of <code>する</code>, <code>し</code> + <code>なさい</code> or <code>な</code>.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, that in itself isn&#39;t particularly confusing.</p><p>What can confuse people is that if we say, for example,</p><p><code>バカにするな</code> (don&#39;t make fun of me, of her);</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>それを食べるな</code> (don&#39;t eat that!
