Tara, nara - how they really work</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we are going to complete our mini-series on conditionals with the conditionals たら and なら.</p><h2 id="たら-conditional" tabindex="-1">たら Conditional <a class="header-anchor" href="#たら-conditional" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;たら Conditional&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The -たら conditional is particularly easy to form because all we do is</p><p>form a verb or an adjective into its -た/-だ past form, and we know how to do that.</p><p>Once we&#39;ve done that, all we do is add -ら and we have the conditional ready-made.</p><p>It&#39;s no coincidence that -たら and -だら are formed on the past,</p><p>because this is the only conditional that can be used about past events.</p><p>Now, of course, when we are using it about past events it&#39;s not really a conditional,</p><p>because we are no longer saying <code>if...</code>, we are saying <code>when...</code></p><p>We know that the condition was fulfilled because it&#39;s already happened.</p><p>But what it does is shows that the event that happened in the past was unexpected or surprising,</p><p>and this is because rather than using one of the more regular means of showing that one event followed another, such as the -て form or -から, we are using an if-type conditional.</p><p>So we are stressing the fact that what did happen might well not have happened and indeed it might have been more in line with expectation if it hadn&#39;t happened.</p><p>So, if we say <code>家に帰ったらさくらがいた,</code> we&#39;re saying <code>When I returned to the house, Sakura was there,</code> and obviously we&#39;re very surprised to find that Sakura is there.</p><p>She didn&#39;t even have a key; she must have gotten in through the window.</p><p>Sakura does that sort of thing sometimes, you know.</p><p>Now, of course, we can also use it as a true conditional about future events,</p><p>and when we do that, it tends to throw stress on what will happen if the condition is fulfilled, as opposed to -ば/れば, which throws more stress on the question of whether or not the condition will be fulfilled or even the fact that it wasn&#39;t fulfilled.</p><p>And this is perhaps natural, because just as in its past form -たら can mean more-or-less</p><p><code>when</code> something takes place as much as <code>if</code> it takes place,</p><p>it certainly can be used for things that we don&#39;t know whether they will be fulfilled or not.</p><p>Most of the conditionals are interchangeable in many cases, but if we&#39;re talking about</p><p>a condition which we&#39;re fully expecting to be fulfilled, we&#39;re really saying more <code>when</code> than <code>if</code>, we&#39;re most likely to use -たら.</p><p>Another note on the -たら and -ば/-れば is that we sometimes use the forms</p><p>-ったら and -ってば with a small っ before them <strong>to indicate exasperation</strong>.</p><p>So we might say <code>さくらったら</code> or <code>さくらってば</code>.</p><p>And what this literally means is the construction <em>(of which they are abbreviations)</em> of</p><p><code>さくらと言ったら</code> or <code>さくらと言えば</code>, in other words <code>When you speak of Sakura...</code></p><p>And this is a bit like saying, <code>Oh, you</code> or <code>When you speak of Sakura, it&#39;s always something like this, isn&#39;t it?</code></p><p>It&#39;s not flattering, it is critical, but it&#39;s not very strongly so, especially in the case of -ったら.</p><p>It can be quite humorous or joking or a kind of friendly exasperation.</p><p>In my experience, -ってば is more likely to express real exasperation,</p><p>and it can be put on to the end of other things than just a person&#39;s name.</p><p>For example, we might say <code>もう言ったってば</code>, which is <code>I&#39;ve already said that, haven&#39;t I?</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This may be a useful note about たら, so I will leave it here.</p></div><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="なら-conditional" tabindex="-1">なら Conditional <a class="header-anchor" href="#なら-conditional" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;なら Conditional&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, -なら is really the easiest of all conditionals to form, because all we ever do is put -なら</p><p>after what we say and that turns it into a conditional.</p><p>We can put it after nouns and we can put it after complete logical clauses.</p><p>It&#39;s very comfortable after nouns and we don&#39;t need to use a copula, probably because</p><p>the -な of -なら has its roots in the copula itself.</p><p>There are ways of grafting the other conditionals onto nouns, but I haven&#39;t mentioned those,</p><p>because I think it would just be unnecessary complication at this stage.</p><p>Generally speaking, all other things being equal, we&#39;re most likely to use -なら with nouns.</p><p>Now, a characteristic of -なら is that more than the others it can be used of</p><p>present and future conditions that really aren&#39;t in doubt at all.</p><p>So, for example, if Sakura is worried that something may not be possible to her, we might say</p><p><code>さくらなら, できる</code> and that means <code>If it&#39;s Sakura, it will be possible</code>.</p><p>Now, of course, we know it&#39;s Sakura, we&#39;re talking to Sakura, so what we&#39;re really saying is</p><p><code>Since it&#39;s Sakura, it will be possible</code> and we&#39;re using it to reassure Sakura that we have confidence in her.</p><p>You might ask the way to the station; you might say, <code>駅はどこですか</code> and someone</p><p>might reply, <code>駅なら, あそこです</code> and that&#39;s saying <code>If it&#39;s the station you&#39;re asking for, it&#39;s over there.</code></p><p>Now, of course, there isn&#39;t any real doubt that it is the station you&#39;re asking for,</p><p>so it&#39;s more like <code>Since it&#39;s the station you&#39;re asking for, it&#39;s over there.</code></p><p>In both these cases there&#39;s no doubt.</p><p>In the case of Sakura, we&#39;re expressing confidence in her as a person -- if it was someone else, it might not be possible, but if it&#39;s Sakura, since it&#39;s Sakura, it will be possible.</p><p>And with the station, we&#39;re really just confirming that it&#39;s the station we&#39;re talking about.</p><p>And, as I say, the conditionals are very often interchangeable, but knowing the special characteristics of each one helps us to understand exactly what&#39;s going on and which one we might choose ourselves.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>There were no notable pictures in the video - as for their lacking in this lesson here.</p></div>',63),r=[s];function h(l,p,d,c,u,w){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const g=e(n,[["render",h]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
