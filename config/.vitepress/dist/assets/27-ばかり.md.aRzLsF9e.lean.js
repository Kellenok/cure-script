<code>I just came</code> - that&#39;s exactly what we also say in English:</p><p><code>I just came</code> or even <code>I only just came</code>.</p><p>It means that something has happened a very short time ago.</p><p>Why do we use, both in English and Japanese, a word meaning <code>nothing but</code> in this case?</p><p>Well, like many words, it is a hyperbole.</p><p>We discussed hyperboles in the case of <code>まるで</code> in the last lesson, didn&#39;t we?</p><p>When we say <code>I just came/来たばかり(だ)</code>, we are saying that nothing has happened except that I came.</p><p>I came such a short time ago that there hasn&#39;t been time for anything else:</p><p><code>I just came/I only just came/来たばかり(だ)</code>.</p><p>Now, this is very often very much a hyperbole.</p><p>Suppose, for example, that we meet a friend in the street and the friend says &quot;Let&#39;s go</p><p>for coffee and cakes<code> and we say </code>食べたばかり<code> - </code>I just ate&quot;.</p><p>Now, what we&#39;re literally saying here is that I ate such a short time ago - milliseconds ago -</p><p>that nothing else has happened in between eating and now.</p><p>Now, obviously that&#39;s not literally true.</p><p>One must have left the place where one did the eating and walked down the street at least.</p><p>But hyperbolically we&#39;re saying that we ate and nothing else happened between then and now.</p><p>The textbooks will tell you that this use of <code>ばかり</code> is attached to the plain past of a verb.</p><p>Now, that&#39;s true, but it&#39;s also confusing for two reasons.</p><p>First of all, saying <code>plain past</code> implies this whole world where we are taught that</p><p>the <code>real</code> forms of verbs are the <code>ます</code> forms, so we have to deconstruct them every time we do anything with them.</p><p>We don&#39;t need to say <code>plain past</code>, because everything we do with a verb inside of a sentence we are doing to the plain form of the verb even if we are using formal Japanese by putting <strong><strong>です</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>ます</strong></strong> on the end.</p><p><code>です</code> and <code>ます</code> are nothing more than decorative appendages that we put at the very end of a sentence.</p><p>The other thing that makes this explanation confusing is that while it&#39;s true that we</p><p>do put it after the past form of a verb, we are not really attaching it to the past form of the verb. This is not logically what&#39;s happening.</p><p>And it&#39;s one of those things that makes it sound like a random rule when it isn&#39;t.</p><p>What we are attaching <code>ばかり</code> to is a completed action.</p><p>And what we are saying is how long ago it happened.</p><p>We&#39;re saying it happened a very very short time ago.</p><p>So we have to have a completed action and of course it has to be in the past, because</p><p>that&#39;s what we&#39;re saying about it.</p><p>If it were in the non-past it wouldn&#39;t make any sense, would it?</p><p>So we can say it attaches to the plain past of the verb or we can say it attaches exactly</p><p>where it logically has to attach and where it would make no sense if it didn&#39;t.</p><p>Now, the next use of <code>ばかり</code> is one that people sometimes find confusing because it</p><p>expresses that there is a great deal of something.</p><p>Now, <code>ばかり</code> obviously is a limiting word, so why is it used to express that there is</p><p>a great deal of something?</p><p>Now, once again, this is perfectly logical and natural and we use it in English as well.</p><p>If we say <code>There are nothing but cakes in that shop!</code> - now, we may mean it literally,</p><p>but very often we mean there are other things, but there are an awful lot of cakes.</p><p>When I was staying in the countryside in Japan and I was moving to Tokyo for a while, somebody I knew there thought it was a bad idea for me to move to Tokyo and said,<br><code>東京は外人ばかりだ</code> -</p><p><code>In Tokyo there&#39;s nothing but foreigners.</code></p><p>Now of course this person did not mean that there was nothing but foreigners in Tokyo;</p><p>he meant that there are a lot of foreigners in Tokyo - and he knows that I don&#39;t want</p><p>to be associating with foreigners who are going to start talking English at me.</p><p>(It&#39;s all right - I avoided that.)</p><p>So this is just a very obvious, natural use of <code>ばかり</code>.</p><p>Now, we can extend this further by saying that someone is doing something a lot or is doing it continuously.</p><p>Again, the textbooks give you these two meanings and make it sound a little complicated, but</p><p>there&#39;s nothing complicated about it.</p><p>It&#39;s very easy to understand from context.</p><p>The way we do it is that we put <code>ばかり</code> after the て-form of the verb.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, if you&#39;ve ever heard <code>犬のおまわりさん</code>, which is a charming children&#39;s song about</p><p>a lost kitten: <code>まいごのまいごのこねこちゃん</code> -</p><p>I&#39;ll put a link below so you can listen to it if you would like to.</p><p>Now, when the dog policeman (<code>犬のおまわりさん</code>) asks the kitten what her name is and where</p><p>she lives, the song says <code>ないてばかりいるこねこちゃん</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>ないてばかり</code> means <code>doing nothing but cry</code>.</p><p>That&#39;s what it literally means, and in this case it means it quite literally.</p><p>She did nothing but cry.</p><p>She went on crying and she didn&#39;t answer, she didn&#39;t say what her name was or where she lived.</p><p>And that&#39;s where we get the idea of continuing to do something.</p><p>You don&#39;t stop doing it, you don&#39;t do anything else, you go on doing it: <code>してばかり</code>.</p><p>It can also be used figuratively.</p><p>You can say that somebody does nothing but play golf.</p><blockquote><p>$&amp;</p></blockquote><p>Now, in this case it&#39;s a hyperbole, isn&#39;t it?</p><p>Nobody does nothing but play golf.</p><p>Everybody sometimes eats, sometimes sleeps, and occasionally plays <code>Captain Toad</code>, because everybody plays <code>Captain Toad</code> sometimes.</p><p>So we have a hyperbole.</p><p>We&#39;re not saying that someone continues doing something and doesn&#39;t do anything else.</p><p>We&#39;re saying that they do it an awful lot.</p><p>It&#39;s a simple enough hyperbole and exactly the same hyperbole that we would have in English:</p><p><code>She does nothing but play Nintendo</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>ばかり</code> can also be used to make two conjunctions.</p><p>Conjunctions, as we know, are things that connect together two complete logical clauses</p><p>in a compound sentence.</p><p>So we can say <code>うたったばかりか、おどった</code> - <code>she didn&#39;t just sing, she also danced</code>.</p><p>Now, the only thing you really have to understand here is the use of <code>か</code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>か</code>, as we know, is the question marker and, as we discussed last week, it can turn a statement</p><p>into a hypothesis, a question for discussion.</p><p>But it can also do another thing and that is it can, especially in colloquial usage,</p><p>throw things into the negative.</p><p>And we have the same in English, don&#39;t we?</p><p>When we ask a question in order to show a negative.</p><p>We can say <code>Do you think I&#39;m going to do that?</code></p><p>meaning <code>I&#39;m not going to do that.</code></p><p>And it&#39;s the same with <code>か</code> in Japanese: in some cases we put <code>か</code> after something to say it isn&#39;t the case.</p><p>So if we say <code>ばかり</code> we&#39;re saying <code>only that is the case</code> and if we say <code>ばかりか</code> we&#39;re</p><p>saying <code>not only that is the case</code>.</p><p>The other common conjunction we make with <code>ばかり</code> is <code>ばかりに</code>.</p><p><code>に</code> can sometimes be added to something in order to make a conjunction.</p><p>We&#39;ve seen this with <code>のに</code> and I made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au5JOtcwE7A&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>video</strong></a> about this a while ago</p><p>which you may want to watch.</p><p><code>ばかりに</code> is an explanatory conjunction.</p><p>We&#39;re saying that something happened and then we&#39;re putting a <code>because</code> at the end of it and saying it was because something else happened.</p><p>The most usual explanatory conjunctions are <code>から</code> or <code>ので</code>, but <code>ばかりに</code> has a special implication.</p><p>It&#39;s not just saying that something happened because of something, it&#39;s saying that it</p><p>happened JUST because of something.</p><p>Again we can liken <code>ばかり</code> to English <code>just</code>.</p><p><code>耳が大きいばかりに、 誰も遊んでくれない</code> - <code>Just because my ears are big, no one will play with me.</code></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The textbooks will perhaps caution you here that <code>ばかりに</code> doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p><p>this conjunction, and that&#39;s true.</p><p>But understanding it from context is simple because we all know that a conjunction can</p><p>only sit at the end of a complete logical clause that&#39;s followed by another logical clause.</p><p>If <code>ばかりに</code> is not at the end of a logical clause then it&#39;s not the conjunction, and</p><p>if it&#39;s in the middle of a sentence, which it normally will be, it must make sense to put a comma after it.</p><p>Because all conjunctions must logically be able to take a comma after them.</p>',137)]))}const f=t(c,[["render",d]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
