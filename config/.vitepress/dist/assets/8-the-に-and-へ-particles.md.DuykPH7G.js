class="header-anchor" href="#the-に-particle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The に Particle&quot;">​</a></h2><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we are going to talk about the particle <code>に</code>,</p><p>and in doing so we are going to level up.</p><p>What do I mean by that?</p><p>In the past seven lessons we&#39;ve learned quite a lot of basic Japanese structure.</p><p>We can say quite a lot of things now if we have the vocabulary.</p><p>But everything we can say is very, very concrete.</p><p>We can talk about doing things and being things, which of course is the core of every sentence.</p><p>But we also need to have some more sophisticated concepts at our disposal.</p><p>Things like purpose and intention and transformation.</p><p>So today we&#39;re going to look at uses of the に-particle, some of which are very concrete still and some of which begin to take us into those more sophisticated areas.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, we&#39;ve already looked at the に-particle, haven&#39;t we?</p><p>And <strong>we know that in a logical sentence it marks the ultimate target of an action.</strong></p><p>So <code>(zeroが)さくらにボールをなげた</code> means <code>I threw the ball at Sakura</code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The ball is marked by を because it&#39;s the thing I actually threw.</p><p>I am marked by が whether you can see me or not,</p><p>because I am the one who did the action of throwing.</p><p><strong>But Sakura is marked by に because she is the target of that action,<br> in this case very literally.</strong></p><p>Now, <strong>the に-particle nearly always marks a target of one kind or another.</strong></p><p><strong>So, if we are going somewhere or sending something somewhere or putting something somewhere, we use に for that <code>somewhere</code>.</strong></p><p><strong>So if A is going to B, then B is marked by に.</strong></p><p><strong>B is the destination, the target of that going.</strong></p><p>So if I&#39;m going to the park, I say <code>(zeroが)こうえんにいく</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If I&#39;m going to the shops, I say <code>(zeroが)おみせにいく</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>So the literal, physical destination or target of movement is marked by に.</strong></p><p><strong>However, we can also mark a subtler kind of target.</strong></p><p>So we can say <code>(zeroが)おみせにたまごを<strong>かいに</strong>いく</code>.</p><p>This means <code>I go to the shops <strong>to buy</strong> eggs</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>おみせ</code> is <code>shop/s</code> – <code>shop</code> is <code>みせ</code> and we put the honorific <code>お</code> on it because we</p><p>give honor to the people who help us to have all the<br> lovely things that we are lucky enough to have.</p><p><code>たまご</code> are eggs – you might, if you&#39;re old enough, remember たまごっち/Tamagotchi,</p><p>the little egg-person that you raise.</p><p><strong>And <code>かい</code> is the い-stem of <code>かう</code> – to buy.</strong></p><p>The い-stem is a very special stem and it can do lots of things,</p><p><strong>and it can also just be there on its own.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>かいにいく</code> means <code>[go] in order to buy, for the purpose of buying</code>.</p><hr><p>Now, you may be saying, <code>I thought that logical particles like に and が and を can only mark nouns</code> – and that&#39;s absolutely correct.</p><p>Because <strong>one of the things that the い-stem of a verb can do when it&#39;s on its own is turn</strong></p><p><strong>that verb into the equivalent noun.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Refer to Lesson 7.5, the い-stem, converting verbs</p></div><p>(It can do something else as well, but I can talk about that another day.)</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So <strong><code>かい</code>, the act of buying, is a noun.</strong></p><p>Just as in English if we say <code>I like swimming</code>,</p><p><code>swimming</code> is a noun, swimming is a thing I like,</p><p>and if we say <code>I go to the shop for the purpose of buying eggs</code>,</p><p>then that <code>buying</code> is also a noun, it&#39;s the thing we&#39;re going for.</p><p>And <code>かい</code> is just like that.</p><hr><p><strong>So <code>かい</code> is the thing we&#39;re going to do and it&#39;s a noun and it&#39;s marked by に.</strong></p><p>So, you see that in this sentence we have two targets:</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>the shops – <code>おみせ</code> – is the actual physical target of our going, the place,</p><p><strong>and buying eggs is the reason for our going, so that&#39;s the emotional target, the volitional target, a more subtle kind of target</strong> than the physical place we&#39;re going to, but still a target.</p><p><strong>And it&#39;s possible to have two targets in the same sentence, both marked by に.</strong></p><p>And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing here.</p><p><strong>So に gives us the target of an action in the most literal sense and also the volitional</strong></p><p><strong>target, the actual aim of our action.</strong></p><p>Now, to get back to more concrete things,<br><strong>に which marks the actual location target<br> of where we&#39;re going, of where we&#39;re putting something,</strong></p><p><strong>can also mark the place where a person or a thing IS.</strong></p><p>So I can say, <code>おみせにいく</code> – <code>I am going to the shops / I will go to the shops</code> – and</p><p>we can say, <code>おみせにいる</code> – <code>I am at the shops</code>.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>こうえんにいく</code> – <code>I&#39;ll go to the park</code>; <code>こうえんにいる</code> -<code>I&#39;m at the park</code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now you see, <strong>this is also a target, because in order for a thing to be anywhere,</strong></p><p><strong>it must have gotten there at some point.</strong></p><p><strong>So <code>に</code> can mark not only a future target, a place where I will go to, it can also mark</strong></p><p><strong>a past target, a place where I went and where I still am.</strong></p><hr><p>And <strong>we also use this for inanimate objects</strong>: <code>ほんはテーブルのうえにある</code> –</p><p><code>The book is on the table</code>.</p><p><code>うえ</code> is a noun, and in this case it means the <code>on</code> of the table.</p><p><code>うえ</code> can mean <code>up</code> or <code>over</code>, in this case it means <code>on</code>, and <strong>it&#39;s always a noun</strong>,<br> so in this case the <code>on of the table</code> is the place where the book is:</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>the past target of the book, to which it went and at which it now remains</strong>.</p><p><strong>So に can also mark the place where a thing is, its past target.</strong></p><h3 id="に-marking-the-target-of-a-transformation" tabindex="-1">に marking the target of a transformation <a class="header-anchor" href="#に-marking-the-target-of-a-transformation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;に marking the target of a transformation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And the last aspect of <code>に</code> that I want to look at is that</p><p><strong>に can also mark the target of a transformation.</strong></p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Just as if A is going to B, に marks B, the place where it&#39;s going,</p><p><strong>if A turns into B, becomes B, then に also marks B</strong>,<br> the thing it&#39;s becoming, the thing it turns into.</p><p>So if I say, <code>さくらはかえるになった</code>...</p><p><code>かえる</code> is <code>frog</code> and <code>なる</code> is a close cousin of <code>ある</code>:<br><code>ある</code> means <code>be</code>; <code>なる</code> means <code>become</code>.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, <code>さくらはかえるになった</code> – <code>Sakura became a frog / Sakura turned into a frog</code>,</p><p><strong>and に marks the thing she became, the thing she turned into.</strong></p><p>Now, you may be thinking, <code>Mmm, how often do people turn into frogs these days?</code> –</p><p>and I&#39;ll grant that it isn&#39;t very often.</p><p>However, <strong>this is a very important thing to learn because</strong></p><p><strong>there are various more everyday things that turn into other things and also we use this form of expression much more in Japanese than we do in English.</strong></p><hr><p>For example, <code>ことし(zeroが)十八さいになる</code>:</p><p><code>ことし</code> is <code>this year</code>, <code>十八さい/じゅうはっさい</code> is <code>18 years of age</code>.</p><p>So we&#39;re saying, <code>This year (I) become 18</code>. <em>Or as given: <code>This year (I) 18 years old-to become</code>.</em></p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now in English we&#39;d say that a little differently:</p><p>we might say, <code>I turn 18</code> or <code>I&#39;ll be 18</code>,</p><p>but in Japanese we say <code>I will become 18 years of age</code>.</p><p>And if the day&#39;s going to get cloudy, we might say <code>あとで(zeroが)くもりになる</code></p><p>(<code>くもり</code> is <code>cloudy</code>; <code>くも</code> is a cloud, <code>くもり</code> is the state of being cloudy,<br> and both of them are nouns).</p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We say, <code>くもりになる</code> which means <code>become cloudy</code>. <em>Or as given: <code>Cloudy-to become</code>.</em></p><p>In English we could say that.</p><p>We might be more likely to say <code>get cloudy</code> or something, but in Japanese</p><p>we use this <code>become</code> – <code>になる</code> – form of speech a lot of the time.</p><p>So it&#39;s an important thing to learn.</p><h3 id="に-in-the-case-of-adjectives-aka-using-them-as-adverbs" tabindex="-1">に in the case of adjectives (aka using them as adverbs) <a class="header-anchor" href="#に-in-the-case-of-adjectives-aka-using-them-as-adverbs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;に in the case of adjectives (aka using them as adverbs)&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>And I should just add here than in the case of an adjective it works slightly differently.</strong></p><p>So if we want to say <code>Sakura is beautiful</code>, we say <code>さくらがうつくしい</code></p><p>(<code>うつくしい</code> means <code>is-beautiful</code>),</p><p>but if we want to say <code>Sakura became beautiful</code>,</p><p><strong>we can&#39;t use に because <code>うつくしい</code> isn&#39;t a noun.</strong></p><p>It isn&#39;t a carriage, <strong>it&#39;s an engine</strong>, isn&#39;t it?</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>うつくしい is an adjectival/い-engine.</p></div><p>So what do we do?</p><p>What we do is what we discussed last week: <strong>we turn that adjective into its stem.</strong></p><p>So <strong>we take off the い (-i) and add く(-ku).</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The stem is うつくし, and then add く.</p></div><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>the く is turning うつくしい into an adverb/adverbial noun. More on that in Lesson 41.</p></div><p><img src="'+k+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And that&#39;s all we need to do.</p><p>That&#39;s how we use it: <code>さくらがうつくしくなった</code> – <code>Sakura became beautiful</code>.</p><p><code>なった</code> is the past of <code>なる</code> because <code>なる</code> is a godan verb<br> (it has to be a godan verb because it doesn&#39;t end in -いる or -える, it ends in -ある).</p><p>So now we know some ways of expressing subtler concepts like intention, purpose, transformation – and we have leveled up.</p><h2 id="the-へ-particle" tabindex="-1">The へ Particle <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-へ-particle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The へ Particle&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Before we finish, I&#39;m just going to give you one more carriage that we haven&#39;t seen before,</p><p>and that&#39;s the へ-car.
