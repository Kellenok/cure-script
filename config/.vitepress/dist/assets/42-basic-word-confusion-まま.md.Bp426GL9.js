Basic word-confusion | まま mama | Lesson 42</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about some of the ways in which the standard conventional explanations of Japanese lead you out into the desert and then fly away in a helicopter, laughing.</p><p>We talked in the earlier lessons in this series about how that happens</p><p>in relation to the fundamental structure of the language.</p><p>But this also happens at a later stage with the explanation of all kinds of what they call <code>grammar points</code>.</p><p>And one of the main causes of this is the fact that they fail to recognize what words actually are and what they actually do.</p><p>So, we&#39;re going to take, as an example, <code>まま</code>, the word <code>ママ</code>.</p><p>Now, this can mean a mother or the mistress of a bar or a cafe, but we&#39;re talking about</p><p>it in the other sense, the more abstract sense, which, if we look at traditional explanations,</p><p>they seem to have various opinions on what part of speech it is.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>to avoid confusion, ママ in katakana means <code>mom</code> or <code>mistress of a bar</code>. Whereas まま is what Dolly is going to be talking about. It also has a Kanji form 儘 or 侭, but that is not really used.<br> So まま ≠ ママ, different things. まま marks unchanged state, ママ means <code>mom/bar mistress</code>...</p></div><p>I&#39;ve even seen it described as a particle, which it certainly isn&#39;t.</p><p>And they tell you that it means <code>as it is / as we wish it to be / as we would like it to be</code>,</p><p>that it means a state or a condition.</p><p>Now, all those things are things that we might say in English in relation to certain uses of the word.</p><p>But none of them express what the word actually means.</p><p>In any case, if it meant <code>as it is</code> or <code>as we wish it to be</code>, what kind of a word would it be?</p><p>So the first thing to ask ourselves is <code>What kind of a word is it?</code></p><p>And, as I explained in our last lesson, nearly all Japanese words fall into one of three categories: nouns, verbs, and adjectives.</p><p>Now, <code>まま</code> is not a verb: it doesn&#39;t end in -う or any う-row kana.</p><p>It&#39;s not an adjective: doesn&#39;t end in -い.</p><p>So the chances are it&#39;s a noun, and that&#39;s exactly what it is. It&#39;s a noun.</p><p>So, what kind of a noun is it? What does it mean?</p><p>What is a <code>まま</code>? A <code>まま</code> is a thing; it&#39;s a noun. What kind of a thing is it?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s a very simple thing, a very straightforward thing, and once we know what it is</p><p>we can understand it in all circumstances.</p><p>A <code>まま</code> is an unchanged condition.</p><p>Wherever you see <code>まま</code>, you can read <code>unchanged condition</code>.</p><p>There&#39;s one circumstance in which it has a slightly extended meaning and apart from that</p><p>-- which is very simple and we&#39;ll come to that shortly --</p><p>we have the definition, the understanding of <code>まま</code>: <code>unchanged condition</code>.</p><p>So, let&#39;s look at some of the ways in which it&#39;s used.</p><p>We can say <code>自然のままの森</code> -- that&#39;s <code>a forest in its natural <em>(unchanged)</em> state</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>自然</code> is nature<code> and </code>まま<code> is </code>unchanged state<code> or </code>unchanged condition&quot;.</p><p>So, <code>自然のまま</code> is the <code>unchanged condition of nature</code>.</p><p><code>自然のままの森</code> is <code>the forest in the unchanged condition of nature</code>.</p><p>Now, when you&#39;re in Japan somebody may offer you 枝豆/えだまめ,</p><p>which are beans which grow from the branches of trees,</p><p>which is why they&#39;re called 枝豆 (which means <code>branch bean</code>).</p><p>And you might look at them, they&#39;re not cooked or anything,</p><p>you might say <code>そのままで食べられるの?</code></p><p>-- <code>Can you eat them just as they are / can you eat them in their unchanged condition?</code></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, that <code>で</code> is in fact the copula, so we&#39;re saying <code>being their unchanged condition, can we eat them?</code></p><p>Now, there&#39;s one thing we can do with <code>まま</code> that we can&#39;t do with all nouns</p><p>and that is that we can drop that <code>で</code>.</p><p>So we can say <code>そのまま食べられる?</code></p><p>Now, we can say that this is because <code>まま</code> is something like an adverbial noun</p><p>that we discussed last week, where you are allowed to drop the particle in certain cases,</p><p>but I don&#39;t think we necessarily even have to go that far.</p><p><code>An unchanged condition</code> is by definition a condition that could change but hasn&#39;t changed.</p><p>So, I think in cases like this if we say <code>そのまま食べられる</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>そのまま食べられる</code> without the <code>で</code>,</p><p>I would say, is treating that <code>そのまま</code> like a relative time expression.</p><p>We&#39;re saying <code>while they&#39;re in their unchanged condition</code>,</p><p>so we&#39;re essentially talking about a time period,</p><p>the time period during which they are in their unchanged condition.</p><p>So this is actually how I would tend to look at it.</p><p><code>During the period when they&#39;re in their unchanged condition, can we eat them?</code></p><p>In any case, there&#39;s no doubt what the word means.</p><p>It means <code>unchanged condition</code>.</p><p>We can say <code>パジャマのまま朝ごはんを食べる</code>.</p><p>That means <code>Eat breakfast while we&#39;re still in our pyjamas</code>.</p><p>In other words, <code>in the unchanged condition of being still in our pyjamas, eat breakfast</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And as we can see, once again the implication here is that the condition could change but hasn&#39;t changed.</p><p><code>いつまでも若いままでいたい</code> -- <code>I&#39;d like to stay young forever.</code></p><p><code>I&#39;d like to stay in the unchanged condition of being young forever.</code></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And notice here that we&#39;re saying <code>若いまま</code>,</p><p>so you see <code>若い</code>, the adjective, is doing what adjectives always do, qualifying a noun.</p><p>And the noun it&#39;s qualifying is <code>まま</code>: <code>the unchanged condition of being young</code>.</p><hr><p>Now, there&#39;s a use of <code>まま</code> that you&#39;ll probably come across quite often,</p><p>and that is <code>思いのまま</code> or <code>心のまま</code>.</p><p>And what this means is <code>in the unchanged condition that&#39;s in our thoughts</code> or <code>...in our hearts</code>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what does this actually mean?</p><p>Well, it&#39;s always applied to something that is outside ourselves,</p><p>so we&#39;re talking about something outside ourselves being in the unchanged condition,</p><p>the exact same condition, as what is inside ourselves.</p><p>So this essentially means making the outside world conform to our thoughts, our desires, our will.</p><p>And this can under certain circumstances imply selfishness, but it doesn&#39;t need to.</p><p>I think the first time I heard it was in an anime where the characters were underwater.</p><p>They were able to breathe but they found that they couldn&#39;t move the way that they wanted to,</p><p>just as one can&#39;t in water.</p><p>And they said <code>思いのままに動けない</code> --</p><p><code>we are unable to move in the unchanged condition of our thoughts</code></p><p>or <code>...the unchanged condition of our will or desire</code>.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, we should understand here that <code>思い</code> sometimes does imply desire.</p><p>For example, when we say <code>片思い</code>, which is literally <code>one-sided thought</code><br> or <code>one-side thought</code>, what that actually means is <code>unrequited love</code>.</p><p>It means having a desire for someone but it&#39;s only one side of the desire.</p><p>The other person doesn&#39;t reciprocate that desire.</p><p>So it&#39;s <code>片思い</code> -- <code>one-sided thought</code> or <code>one-sided desire</code>.</p><p>So <code>思いのまま</code> is <code>in the unchanged condition of one&#39;s thought or desire</code>.</p><p>And it&#39;s really from this use of <code>まま</code> that we get <code>わがまま</code>, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard,</p><p>which means <code>selfish</code> or <code>selfishness</code>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Why does it mean that?</p><p>Well, <code>我が/わが</code> means <code>I</code> or <code>we</code> and it can be put next to a noun to denote possession of it. So we can say <code>わが家</code>, which means <code>my house</code> or <code>our house</code>.</p><p><code>わがまま</code> means <code>my unchanged condition</code>, but this clearly is influenced by expressions like <code>思いのまま</code> or <code>心のまま</code>.</p><p>So this <code>わがまま</code> means <code>my unchanged condition</code> implying <code>my will</code>,</p><p><code>wanting the world to go in accordance with my will,</code></p><p>wanting the world to be <code>思いのまま</code>, <code>心のまま</code>.</p><p>So as we see the whole of <code>まま</code>, we don&#39;t have to have all these different definitions of it.</p><p>We can see that every time we use it it means the same thing.</p><p>It means <code>unchanged condition</code>...</p>',111)]))}const v=o(l,[["render",u]]);export{k as __pageData,v as default};
