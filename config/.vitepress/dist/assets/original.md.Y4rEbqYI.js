Provided it was mentioned &amp; Dolly responded to it, but I would not take her as gospel too much. Since she is no longer here, we cannot ask her to elaborate on stuff, do not get me wrong, she was clearly knowledgeable, but due to her course being mostly aimed at beginners, stuff is often somewhat simplified which might later on cause misunderstandings hence why I say this.</p><p>But, do refer to her word over mine. I do tend to sometimes speculate in my notes and go on long essays in them about how I understand things, but obviously that is just me speculating and looking up some sources online for it that SEEM to suggest it, I do it for myself mainly, I do not intend to undermine Dolly or such with them. You should take my long speculating notes with some skepticism. Moreover, they are fully optional so you can skip them.</p><p><em>The normal underline marks important info by Dolly or to highlight discussed parts of sentences.

Let me know if you see white lines or glitching while scrolling (especially in the later half of the document) as I switched to the pageless mode which seems more fitting for a document this huge. After some testing, it seems to be due to a bloated browser (when you use lots of extensions like I do, and keep all your Cache/Cookies always etc.) so you can try letting it load a bit or simply clear your Cache/browser (it will sign you off), or you may have an unstable Internet connection or such. <a href="https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Yomitan</strong></a> by <a href="https://learnjapanese.moe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>TheMoeWay</strong></a> works for Google Docs, so use it; or you can use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/10ten-japanese-reader-rik/pnmaklegiibbioifkmfkgpfnmdehdfan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>10ten/Rikaichamp</strong></a> (or both). Since <a href="https://foosoft.net/posts/sunsetting-the-yomichan-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Yomichan ended development</a>, it will likely become incompatible in the future and Yomitan continues its legacy now. RIP Legend. Another continuation is <a href="https://github.com/forsakeninfinity/yomibaba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Yomibaba</strong></a>, if anything happens to Yomitan. However, Yomitan cannot scan differently modified text, e.g. 歩く / 歩く / 歩く (く is italic) so scanning both will result in Yomitan not being able to scan both at once… I do not know why this is, if you know please PM me… however, 10ten/Rikaichamp is completely fine with scanning this, so use that one then.</p></details><h2 id="in-memory-of-cure-dolly" tabindex="-1">In Memory of Cure Dolly <a class="header-anchor" href="#in-memory-of-cure-dolly" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;In Memory of Cure Dolly&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Hello, everyone. My name is Cure Dolly and I am here to teach you Organic Japanese. What is Organic Japanese? It is Japanese pure and simple, with no harmful additives. Japanese is the simplest, most logical, most easily understandable language I have ever encountered – much easier than Western languages.</p><p>But you wouldn’t know that if you try to learn it from Western textbooks or Japanese learning websites. Why not? Because they don’t teach Japanese structure. They teach English structure and then try to force Japanese into it. And it doesn’t fit, and it doesn’t work very well. That is the main reason, I think, why so many people give up Japanese. The Western system makes it seem complicated, full of strange exceptions and odd rules that you have to memorize. And none of this is true if you learn the language the way it really is.</p><p>So, this course is not just for people beginning Japanese. It’s very good for those people – this is the best way to start. But if you’ve been learning Japanese for a while and you find yourself getting confused by things, it would be very good to watch this series and learn from the start the way Japanese should have been explained in the first place. All right, let’s get started.</p>',29)]))}const p=t(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
