Deeper secret of the copula. +The Tae Kim fallacy | Lesson 79</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about something</p><p>that&#39;s absolutely crucial to the core structure of Japanese.</p><p>We&#39;ve talked about this recently in relation to Tae Kim-sensei</p><p>and the way he disrupts our understanding of this particular thing.</p><p>What it is is the copula, and this really governs an awful lot</p><p>of what we can say and communicate in language itself.</p><p>It&#39;s crucial to how we conceptualize the world.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, Tae Kim never actually uses the C-word, <code>copula</code>,</p><p>and that&#39;s a large part of the problem.</p><p>But some people may be asking not so much why Tae Kim doesn&#39;t, as why I do.</p><p>After all, I try to avoid technical linguistic and grammatical terminology as far as possible.</p><p>I don&#39;t often use the word <code><strong>grammatical subject</strong></code>;</p><p>I even less often use the word <code><strong>predicate</strong></code>.</p><p><strong>I prefer to say <code>A-car</code> and <code>B-engine</code>.</strong></p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That way we all know what we&#39;re talking about.</p><p>So why do I use this abstract and rather horrible word, <code>copula</code>?</p><h2 id="what-is-a-copula" tabindex="-1">What is a “Copula” <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-copula" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is a “Copula”&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Well, the reason is that English doesn&#39;t have a dedicated copula,</p><p>so it can be quite difficult for English speakers to grasp exactly what a copula is.</p><p>I have to introduce that function as something in itself.</p><p>When Tae Kim talks about copular expressions,</p><p>he refers to them as <code>state-of-being</code> expressions,</p><p>and this really is the key to the whole problem.</p><p>So, what is the copula, and why does English not have a dedicated copula,</p><p>and why does it matter so much?</p><p>Let&#39;s start off with <code>what is a copula?</code></p><p>The simplest way of defining a copula is that <strong>it is a one way equals sign</strong>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>It tells us that A is B</strong>, <strong>although B is not necessarily A</strong>.</p><p>So, <code>さくらは日本人<strong>です</strong></code>. <em>(Obviously, だ also)</em></p><p>Sakura <strong>is</strong> a Japanese person; <strong>a Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura.</strong></p><p>Now, that is the simple explanation.</p><p>But if we go a little deeper, <strong>what the copula actually does is place things in sets</strong>.</p><p><code>さくらは日本人<strong>です</strong></code> <strong>means that Sakura belongs to the set <code>Japanese person</code></strong>.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And this is fundamentally important for language,</p><p>which is the tool humans use to conceptualize the world,</p><p>the things they see about them, the visible and perceptible universe.</p><p>Placing things into categories is our most fundamental way of dealing with them.</p><p><strong>A rose belongs to the set <code>flower</code></strong>.</p><p><strong>Flower belongs to the set <code>growing things</code></strong>.</p><p><strong>Growing things belongs to the set <code>living things</code></strong>.</p><p><strong>Living things belongs to the set <code>things</code></strong>.</p><p>All the time we are placing things into sets, and that&#39;s the way we conceptualize them.</p><p>We could say very little about anything if we weren&#39;t able to place things into sets.</p><p>So <strong>this, fundamentally, is what the copula does</strong>.</p><p><strong>It gives us a very simple, straightforward, unfussy way of putting anything into a set at any time,</strong></p><p><strong>of defining at any time the set to which something belongs.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Now, the set may only be a set of one. In that case the equals sign works both ways.</strong></p><p>So, for example, if I say <code>That person over there is Sakura</code>,</p><p>well, that particular person over there and Sakura are the same person.</p><p><strong>Sakura is a set of one to which that person over there, and that person over there only, belongs.</strong></p><p><strong>At least, this particular Sakura.</strong> <strong>We&#39;re not talking about all people called Sakura</strong>, obviously.</p><p>So this is what the copula does. Why so much confusion about it?</p><p>Isn&#39;t it a relatively simple function? Well yes, it is a simple function.</p><p>The main problem here, as very often with Western misconceptions of Japanese,</p><p>lies not in Japanese but in the nature of the English language itself.</p><p><strong>English, as I said, doesn&#39;t have a dedicated copula.</strong></p><p><strong>It does have a copula. Every language has to have a copula.</strong></p><p>If we didn&#39;t have something that performed the copular function,</p><p>we just wouldn&#39;t be able to put things into sets,</p><p>which means that we would be very limited in our ability to conceptualize things.</p><p><strong>So what English does is that it doubles up the verb of being with the copula.</strong></p><p><strong>The verb of being is something that simply tells us that something exists.</strong></p><p><strong>It has various forms: <code>is / am / are / was</code> etc.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, if we say <code>I <strong>am</strong> an American</code>, that&#39;s <strong>the copula</strong> at work.</p><p>We&#39;re saying <strong>I belong to the set called <code>American people</code></strong>.</p><p>If we say <code>I think, therefore I am</code>, we&#39;re using the verb of being.</p><p><strong>We&#39;re not saying anything about what I am, what set I belong to.</strong></p><p>We&#39;re simply saying that because I think, we can state confidently that I exist.</p><p>Now, because English does not have two separate words for those two concepts,</p><p>it doesn&#39;t actually cause much trouble to native speakers of English</p><p>or to foreign speakers who have learned English at least partly through immersion,</p><p>because after a while it all becomes clear through usage and experience,</p><p>but <strong>it does cause trouble when English tries to look at languages that have a separate copula.</strong></p><p>Japanese obviously is one of these, and Spanish is another.</p><hr><p><strong>The Spanish language has two copulas, <code>ser</code> and <code>estar</code></strong>:</p><p><code>ser</code>, which tells us the permanent set to which something belongs,</p><p>and <code>estar</code>, which tells us the relatively temporary set to which something belongs.</p><p>That&#39;s a distinction that most languages don&#39;t make. <strong>But the important distinction here</strong></p><p><strong>is that <code>ser</code> and <code>estar</code> are not the same as <code>haber</code>, which is the verb of being.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So if we say <code>Estos <strong>son</strong> huevos</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>These <strong>are</strong> eggs</code>; <em>(“son” should be copula here)</em></p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>if we say <code><strong>Hay</strong> huevos</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>Eggs <strong>exist</strong></code> -- two entirely different kinds of statement.</p><p>As I say, <strong>in English we don&#39;t get confused between those two kinds of statement,</strong></p><p><strong>but when we try to apply English explanations to languages that do have</strong></p><p><strong>different words for the copula and the verb of being, confusion often ensues.</strong></p><h2 id="だ-です-being-the-same-copula" tabindex="-1">だ &amp; です being the same copula <a class="header-anchor" href="#だ-です-being-the-same-copula" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;だ &amp; です being the same copula&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, some of the people who commented on my video on Tae Kim versus the copula</p><p>were not entirely convinced by my argument that <code>です</code> and <code>だ</code> are the same thing,</p><p>because Tae Kim argues so strongly that they aren&#39;t.</p><p>I think I disposed of most of them. I didn&#39;t dispose of all of them because I wasn&#39;t trying to be exhaustive.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And I&#39;m not going to deal with those arguments here either, because I think they&#39;re peripheral.</p><p>I will in fact be dealing with them in a video in the fairly near future,</p><p><strong>but the point here is that taking arguments like</strong></p><p><code>だ isn&#39;t necessarily needed in this case but です is</code></p><p>as a way of sustaining the larger argument that <code>だ</code> and <code>です</code> are not the same thing</p><p><strong>is taking the whole thing upside down and inside out.</strong></p><p><strong>What&#39;s important is not that <code>だ</code> and <code>です</code> function a little differently in this way or that way,</strong></p><p><strong>that <code>だ</code> can be dropped here and <code>です</code> can&#39;t be dropped there, things like that.</strong></p><p>They&#39;re entirely peripheral to the issue of the fact that <strong>they are both the copula</strong>.</p><p>And the fundamental argument against this fallacy is simply this:</p><p>we know that <strong>every language needs to have a copula.</strong></p><p><strong>Without a copular function, you can&#39;t say half of the things that language absolutely needs to say.</strong></p><p>You don&#39;t have a real language.</p><p><strong>You have a broken language if you don&#39;t have any copular function.</strong></p><p>Now, Japanese sometimes speaks in 丁寧語 (in です/ます speak <em>= polite language</em>)</p><p>and sometimes speaks in straightforward, plain Japanese.</p><p><strong>The copula in one is <code>です</code></strong> <em>(polite)</em><strong>; the copula in the other is <code>だ</code>.</strong> <em>(plain)</em></p><p>Now, if you&#39;re going to argue that they&#39;re not the same thing,</p><p>therefore that one of them is not the copula,</p><p>then you have to come up with what the copula is,</p><p>in either plain language or 丁寧語 (です/ます language),</p><p>because <strong>both of them have to have a copula.</strong></p><p><strong>You have no language without a copula</strong>, so it&#39;s incumbent on you,</p><p>if you&#39;re saying that they&#39;re not the same thing,</p><p>to tell us where the copula lies in both those forms of speech.</p><p>And of course Tae Kim never tackles this problem</p><p>because he doesn&#39;t really seem to understand that there is a copula</p><p>as opposed to what he calls <code>the state of being</code>.</p><h2 id="copula-vs-state-of-being" tabindex="-1">Copula vs state of being <a class="header-anchor" href="#copula-vs-state-of-being" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Copula vs state of being&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, another thing that people may raise is they may say,</p><p>&quot;Well, surely it isn&#39;t just an accident that English uses the state of being to mean the copula.</p><p>Aren&#39;t the two things somewhat closely related?</p><p>After all, <strong>in older forms of the Japanese copula, like <strong>である</strong> and <strong>でございます</strong>,</strong></p><p><strong>the state of being plays a role. <strong>ある</strong> and <strong>ございます</strong> are state of being words</strong></p><p><strong>even though the <strong>で</strong> changes them to copula.&quot;</strong></p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And the answer to that is absolutely yes.</p><p>And the reasons for this lie in the human perception of ontology,</p><p>that&#39;s to say, the science or philosophy of being itself.</p><p>Humans tend to believe that the set a thing belongs to is fundamental to its being.</p><p><strong>And in a sense that&#39;s certainly true.</strong></p><p><strong>We define something by the set it belongs to, and its existence as the being it is,</strong></p><p><strong>as opposed to any other being, is fundamentally tied up in the set to which it belongs.</strong></p><p>A rose belongs to the set <code>flower</code>. Once we know that, we can guess all sorts of things about it.</p><p>We may not know exactly what it looks like, but we can say</p><p>that it probably has a stem, has petals, has leaves, grows in the earth, etc. etc.</p><p><strong>So the set something belongs to is crucial to its existence</strong></p><p><strong>as that particular being and not another being.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>But understanding that the state of being and the set to which something is attributed</strong></p><p><strong>are related semantically doesn&#39;t mean that we ought to confuse the two.</strong></p><p>When we say <code>I <strong>am</strong> an American</code>, <strong>we do not mean the same thing by <code>am</code></strong></p><p>as we do when we say <code>I think, therefore I <strong>am</strong>.</code></p><p><strong>If we believe that the Japanese copula, which is expressed by <code>だ</code> or <code>です</code>,</strong></p><p><strong>and the state of being, which is expressed by <code>いる</code> or <code>ある</code>, are in fact the same,</strong></p><p><strong>we&#39;ve simply lost a fundamentally important distinction in Japanese.</strong></p><p>Of course, Tae Kim-sensei doesn&#39;t believe that, but at the same time</p><p>he has great difficulty in clarifying what the distinction is,</p><p>and that&#39;s how we can end up thinking that <code>だ</code> and <code>です</code> are not the same thing.</p><p><strong>There are a few cases where <code>だ</code> can be dropped, sometimes grammatically,</strong></p><p><strong>sometimes ungrammatically, which do not apply to <code>です</code></strong>, that&#39;s true,</p><p><strong>but they don&#39;t affect the fact that they&#39;re both the copula.</strong></p><h2 id="one-case-of-です-not-functioning-as-a-copula" tabindex="-1">One case of です not functioning as a copula <a class="header-anchor" href="#one-case-of-です-not-functioning-as-a-copula" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;One case of です not functioning as a copula&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>There&#39;s one case where <code>です</code> is used where it doesn&#39;t function as a copula,</strong></p><p><strong>and that is the case of adjectives.</strong></p><p>As I demonstrated in that previous video <em>(Lesson 78)</em>,</p><p><strong>adjectives are the one case where <code>です</code> is used and it&#39;s not the copula,</strong></p><p><strong>it&#39;s just an empty formality</strong> <em>(politeness)</em> <strong>marker.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="です-in-adjectives-is-not-just-a-random-politeness-marker" tabindex="-1">です in adjectives is not just a random politeness marker <a class="header-anchor" href="#です-in-adjectives-is-not-just-a-random-politeness-marker" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;です in adjectives is not just a random politeness marker&quot;">​</a></h3><p>But there&#39;s another point that we have to consider here, and that is that while in those cases --</p><p>that&#39;s to say, <strong>in the case of adjectives and no other case</strong></p><p>(it only happens in the case of adjectives as I demonstrated in that video) --</p><p><strong>while in the case of adjectives it&#39;s true to say that <code>です</code> is an empty formality marker,</strong></p><p><strong>it&#39;s not just a random empty formality marker.</strong></p><p><em><strong>Like I mentioned earlier, です / ます are rather politeness markers, not formality markers.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>They are part of the 丁寧語 (polite language).
