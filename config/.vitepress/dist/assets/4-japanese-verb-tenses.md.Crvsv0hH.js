How Japanese verb tenses really work</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about tenses.</p><p>Up to now, we&#39;ve only been using one tense, and that is the one represented by</p><p>the plain dictionary form of verbs: 食べる/たべる - eat; 歩く/あるく - walk, and so forth.</p><p>To use natural-sounding Japanese, we need three tenses.</p><p>You might think they would be past, present and future, but in fact they&#39;re not.</p><h2 id="the-non-past-tense" tabindex="-1">The non-past tense <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-non-past-tense" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The non-past tense&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The one we&#39;ve been using up to now is not a present tense.</p><p>It&#39;s called the non-past tense, and a lot of people think this is confusing.</p><p>Why can&#39;t Japanese have a simple present tense like English</p><p>instead of something vague and mysterious like a non-past tense?</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Well, actually it isn&#39;t confusing at all, and what makes it confusing is, for a change,</p><p>not the fact that Japanese is taught in a strange way,</p><p>but the fact that English is taught in a strange way.</p><p>The truth is that the Japanese non-past tense is very similar to the English non-past tense.</p><p>What is the English non-past tense?</p><p>Well, it is the plain dictionary form of English words: eat, walk, etc.</p><p>Why do I call it a non-past tense?</p><p>Well, let&#39;s take an example.</p><p>Suppose you get a message on your 携帯/けいたい (phone) saying,</p><p><code>I walked to the cafe and now I eat cake and drink coffee</code>.</p><p>What would you know about the person who sent that message?</p><p>Well, you&#39;d know that it was not a native English speaker, wouldn&#39;t you?</p><p>Because no native English speaker says <code>I eat cake and I drink coffee</code> when they mean</p><p><code>I am eating cake and drinking coffee right now</code>.</p><p>When so we say <code>I eat cake</code>?</p><p>Well, we might say it when we mean that we eat cake sometimes: &quot;I eat cake.</p><p>I&#39;m not one of these people who doesn&#39;t eat cake. I do eat cake.</p><p>Whenever there&#39;s any cake around, I eat it.</p><p>But that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m eating cake right at this moment.&quot;</p><p>When else do we use the English non-past plain form of verbs?</p><p>Well, sometimes we use them for future events: <code>Next week I fly to Tokyo.</code></p><p><code>Next month I have an exam.</code></p><p>And sometimes we use them for something that&#39;s going on right now, but not mostly.</p><p>For example, in a literary description: &quot;The sun sinks over the sea</p><p>and a small happy robot runs across the beach.&quot;</p><p>But that isn&#39;t the way we use it most of the time in everyday speech, is it?</p><p>So, the Japanese non-past tense is very similar in the way it functions to the English non-past tense.</p><p>If you understand one you can pretty much understand the other.</p><p><strong>Most of the time, the Japanese non-past tense refers to future events.</strong></p><p><code>いぬがたべる</code> - <code>The dog will-eat</code>; <code>さくらがあるく</code> - <code>Sakura will-walk.</code></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The way we&#39;ve been using it up to now - <code>Sakura walks</code> - is possible,</p><p>but it isn&#39;t the most natural way.</p><p>We&#39;ve been using it that way because it was the only tense we knew.</p><h2 id="continuous-actions-and-ている" tabindex="-1">Continuous actions and ている <a class="header-anchor" href="#continuous-actions-and-ている" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Continuous actions and ている&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If we want to say something more natural, like <code>Sakura is walking</code>, what do we do?</p><p>Well, what do we do in English?</p><p>In English we say, don&#39;t we, <code>Sakura IS walking</code>.</p><p>We use the word <code>to be</code>.</p><p>You can <code>BE walking</code>.</p><p><code>Sakura IS walking</code>; <code>We ARE walking.</code></p><p>Fortunately, in Japanese we don&#39;t have all these different forms of the word <code>to be</code>.</p><p>We use the same word every time, and the word is <code>いる</code>.</p><p><code>いる</code> means <code>be</code> <strong>in relation to animals and people</strong>,</p><p>and to make this continuous present tense, we always use <code>いる</code>.</p><p>So, <code>Sakura is walking</code> – <code>さくらがあるいている</code>.</p><p><code>Dog is eating</code> – <code>いぬがたべている</code></p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, let&#39;s notice that in a sentence like <code>いぬがたべている,</code></p><p>we have something we haven&#39;t yet seen, and that&#39;s a white engine.</p><p><strong>A white engine is an element that could be an engine</strong></p><p><strong>but in this case it&#39;s NOT the engine of this sentence.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s modifying, or telling us more about, one of the core elements of the sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, the core of this sentence is <code>いぬがいる</code> - <code>the dog is</code>.</p><p>But the dog isn&#39;t just existing – the dog is doing something.</p><p>And that white engine tells us what it is doing.</p><p>It is <code>eating</code>.</p><p>And we&#39;re going to see this white engine structure over and over again as we go deeper into Japanese.</p><p>And just as in English we don&#39;t say <code>the dog is eat</code>,</p><p>we use a special form of the verb that goes along with the verb of being.</p><p>So in English we say <code>is walking</code>, <code>is eating</code>.</p><p>In Japanese we say <code>食べている/たべている</code>, <code>歩いている/あるいている</code>.</p><hr><p>Now, how do we form this <code>て-form</code>, which is the form we use for making the continuous present?</p><p>With a word like <code>食べる/たべる</code>, it&#39;s very easy indeed.</p><p>All we have to do is take off the <code>る</code> and put <code>て</code> in its place.<br> たべる becomes たべて.</p><p>The bad news is that with other verbs, we do have slightly different ways of attaching the<br><code>て</code>. Apart from the plain る-form, there are four other ways.</p><p>The textbooks will say five, but in fact two of them are so similar that we can treat them as four.</p><p>And I&#39;ve made a video on exactly what these ways are <em>(Lesson 5, so the next lesson).</em></p><p>And it makes it much simpler than most explanations.</p><p>So it&#39;s very important to watch that so that you can learn</p><p>how to form the continuous present tense.</p><p>The good news: it&#39;s perfectly regular.</p><p>Once you know the ending of a verb you also know how to put the <code>て</code> onto it.</p><p>The only one that&#39;s a bit tricky is る-ending verbs, but the video will explain that.</p><h2 id="past-tense" tabindex="-1">Past tense <a class="header-anchor" href="#past-tense" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Past tense&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, how do we put things into the past tense?</p><p>Fortunately that&#39;s very easy indeed.</p><p><strong>All we do is add <code>た</code> – that&#39;s the whole thing.</strong></p><p>So, <code>いぬがたべる</code> – <code>dog will-eat</code> / <code>いぬがたべた</code> – <code>dog ate</code>.</p><p>Now, there are different ways of attaching <code>た</code> to different kinds of verb, verbs with different endings, but the good news here is that they are exactly the same as the ways that you attach <code>て</code>.</p><p>So once you&#39;ve learned the ways that <code>て</code> attaches,</p><p>you&#39;ve also learned the ways that <code>た</code> attaches.</p><p>So if you watch that て-form video <em><strong>(Lesson 5)</strong></em>, you&#39;ll be able to do both the continuous present and the past.</p><p>Now, there&#39;s one more thing about time expressions that is useful to learn now.</p><p>If we want to make it clear, when we say <code>私はケーキを食べる</code>, that we&#39;re talking about</p><p>a future event, we can say <code>明日/あした</code> (which means <code>tomorrow</code>) <code>あしたケーキを食べる</code>.</p><p>That&#39;s all we have to do.</p><h2 id="time-expressions" tabindex="-1">Time expressions <a class="header-anchor" href="#time-expressions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Time expressions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We just say <code>tomorrow</code> before we say the rest of the sentence, just as we do in English.</p><p><code>Tomorrow I&#39;m going to eat cake</code> – <code>あした <em>(zeroが)</em> ケーキを食べる</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Sometimes I add zeroが even when Dolly does not say it in the transcript, BUT she shows it in the videos, I obviously only add it then if it is shown by her, I do not do it on my own…</p></div><p>Now, <code>tomorrow</code> is what we call a <code><strong>relative</strong> time expression</code> because it&#39;s relative to today.</p><p>Today is yesterday&#39;s tomorrow.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And with all relative time expressions like that: yesterday, last week, next year, and</p><p>so forth, times that are relative to the present time, we just do what we did then.</p><p><strong>We put the time expression at the beginning of the sentence</strong></p><p><strong>and that puts that whole sentence into that time.</strong></p><hr><p>However, when we have an <code>absolute time expression</code>, an expression that is not relative to the present, such as Tuesday or six o&#39;clock, then <strong>we have to use <code>に</code></strong>.</p><p>Tuesday is <code>火曜日/かようび</code> and we may may say<br><code>かようびに <em>(zeroが)</em> ケーキをたべる</code> – <code>On Tuesday (I) will eat cake.</code></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The important thing here is that it can seem a bit complicated to have to work out,</p><p><code>Is the time absolute or relative?</code></p><p>And the good thing to know here is that it&#39;s not complicated at all,</p><p>because it works exactly the same as English.</p><p>In English, we say, <code>Tomorrow I eat cake</code>, <code>Next week, I have an exam</code>, and so forth,</p><p><strong>but when we use an absolute time expression</strong> we say, <code><strong>On Monday</strong> I will eat cake</code>,</p><p><code><strong>At six o&#39;clock</strong> I have an exam</code>; if we&#39;re talking about a month we say, <code><strong>In July</strong> I&#39;m going to Tokyo</code>.</p><p>Now, Japanese works in exactly the same way except that we don&#39;t have to remember</p><p>when we&#39;re using <code>on</code>, when we&#39;re using <code>at&#39; and when we&#39;re using </code>in&quot;.</p><p><strong>In Japanese we use <code>に</code> every time.</strong></p><p>But in English when we need one of those little words, <code>on</code>, <code>in</code> or <code>at</code>,<br> then we need <code>に</code> in Japanese.</p><p>And when we don&#39;t, then we don&#39;t need <code>に</code> in Japanese.</p><p><strong>English and Japanese are identical in that respect.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So rather than sitting down to work out <code>Is this relative, or is this absolute?</code>,</p><p><strong>just think whether you need an <code>on</code>, <code>in</code> or <code>at</code> in English, and if you do,</strong></p><p><strong>you need <code>に</code> in Japanese.</strong></p><p>And if you don&#39;t, you don&#39;t need <code>に</code> in Japanese.</p><p>It&#39;s really as simple as that.</p>',137),w=[l];function g(u,m,y,f,k,b){return o(),t("div",null,w)}const I=e(c,[["render",g]]);export{_ as __pageData,I as default};
