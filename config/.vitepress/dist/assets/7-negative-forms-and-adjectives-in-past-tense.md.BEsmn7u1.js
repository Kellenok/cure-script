<code>はなす</code> (speak) becomes <code>はなさない</code> (not-speak); <code>もつ</code> (hold) becomes <code>もたない</code> (not hold), and so forth.</p><p>And as we already know, <strong>with ichidan verbs, they only ever drop that <code>-る</code> and put on</strong></p><p><strong>whatever we want to put on</strong>, so <code>たべる</code> (eat) becomes <code>たべない</code> (not-eat).</p><p>And that&#39;s it.</p><p>That&#39;s how we turn any verb negative.</p><p>It&#39;s very, very simple.</p><h2 id="negative-forms-of-adjectives" tabindex="-1">Negative forms of adjectives <a class="header-anchor" href="#negative-forms-of-adjectives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Negative forms of adjectives&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, what about adjectives?
