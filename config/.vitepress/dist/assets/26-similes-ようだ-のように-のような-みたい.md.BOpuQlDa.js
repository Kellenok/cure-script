we are comparing it to something that it could be but isn&#39;t.</p><p>Now, if we look at the usage of these expressions, we can see that as usual in Japanese they&#39;re very logical.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The textbooks will sometimes give you lists of connections and ways of using them.</p><p>But actually they all make sense.</p><p>We don&#39;t need a list to tell us that <code>ようだ</code> can also be used as the adverb <code>ように</code></p><p>or that it can be placed before something as the adjective <code>ような</code> - because these</p><p>connections are simply the same connections that you can make with any adjectival noun.</p><p>The only thing we have to know is that, just like <code>らしい</code> and unlike <code>そうだ</code>, we can</p><p>use it with any kind of a noun, not just adjectival nouns.</p><p>And that also makes sense because with both <code>らしい</code> and <code>ようだ</code> we can compare things</p><p>to other things, whereas with <code>そうだ</code> we can only conjecture at the quality of a thing,</p><p>something that can be expressed by an adjective or an adjectival noun.</p><p>And when we attach it to a verb, as we&#39;ve seen, it has a slightly different meaning.</p><p>However, <code>ようだ</code> has a special connection that the others don&#39;t have.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>As you know, we can simply pop it onto an entire sentence, as we can the other two,</p><p>with the meaning of <code>(that sentence) is what appears to be the case</code>.</p><p>But we can also put it onto an entire, complete sentence with a different meaning.</p><p>We can do it in order to turn the whole sentence into our simile.</p><p>So, for example, we can say <code>まるでゆうれいを見たかのような顔をした</code> -</p><p><code>She had a face (or made a face) exactly as if she had seen a ghost.</code></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, as we see, <code>she had seen a ghost</code> is an entire logical clause.</p><p>In Japanese we have the zero-particle for <code>she</code>, but it&#39;s a complete logical clause:</p><p><code>she saw a ghost</code> - <code>ゆうれいを見た</code> - <code>zeroがゆうれいを見た</code>.<br> Now, then we put <code>か</code> onto the end of it. What is this <code>か</code>?</p><h2 id="the-か-particle" tabindex="-1">The か particle <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-か-particle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The か particle&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We haven&#39;t talked an awful lot about the か-particle</p><p>because in です/ます Japanese you use it to mark a question.</p><p>You can use it to mark a question in informal Japanese, which is what we usually use here, but mostly we don&#39;t because paradoxically it doesn&#39;t seem polite to put <code>か</code> at the end of an informal question - it tends to seem a little bit blunt or curt.</p><p>However, the question-marker <code>か</code> has another important function.</p><p>And that is that it can bundle a statement into a kind of question, and that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here.</p><p>We start off with <code>まるで</code> to signal that we are going to use a simile.</p><p>Then we make our completed statement - <code>ゆうれいを見た</code> - <code>zeroがゆうれいを見た</code> - <code>she saw a ghost</code>.</p><p>And then we add <code>か</code> and that turns it into a question.<br> It gives us our <code>if</code> - <code>as if she had seen a ghost</code>.</p><p>And that <code>か</code> gives us our questioning <code>if</code>.</p><p>In fact, she hadn&#39;t seen a ghost, so this isn&#39;t really a statement; it&#39;s a possibility, a potentiality, an if.</p><p>What she actually did perhaps was saw the fees that PayPal charged her for an international money transfer.</p><p>We&#39;re not suggesting that she really saw a ghost.</p><p>We are suggesting that the face she manifested - <code>顔をした</code> - was similar to the face</p><p>that she would have manifested if - <code>か</code> - she had seen a ghost.</p><p>Now, the other thing that we need to understand about this <code>か</code> is that it in effect nominalizes</p><p>the logical clause that it marks.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what it&#39;s doing is turning this complete logical clause into a question, a hypothesis, an if, that then functions structurally as a noun.</p><p>So it can be marked by の, which can only happen to a noun.</p><p>And so this new noun, this object that we&#39;ve created from an entire logical clause, can</p><p>now be connected to another noun by the particle の.</p><p><code>よう</code> is a <code>form</code> or a <code>likeness</code> - <code>やまのよう</code> is the form of a mountain,</p><p><code>風のよう</code> is the form or likeness of the wind,<br> and in this case, <code>ゆうれいを見たかのよう</code></p><p>is the likeness of this object that we&#39;ve created from the hypothesis of having seen a ghost.</p><p>Now, again, this is not something we can do with any of the others.<br> We can&#39;t even do it with <code>みたい</code>, which works in most respects pretty much exactly the same as <code>のよう</code>.</p><h2 id="みたい" tabindex="-1">みたい <a class="header-anchor" href="#みたい" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;みたい&quot;">​</a></h2><p><code>みたい</code> is the less formal cousin of <code>よう</code> and broadly means the same thing</p><p>and broadly can be used in the same ways.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s an adjectival noun just like that <code>よう</code>, can be used with <code>に</code> to make it an adverb</p><p>or with <code>な</code> to make it a before-the noun adjective just as any adjectival noun can be.</p><p>The main things to remember about it is simply that it&#39;s less formal, so you don&#39;t use it in an essay.</p><p>On the other hand, you might prefer to choose it when you&#39;re talking to a friend over<br><code>ようだ</code> in many cases, just because it sounds a bit less formal and a bit more friendly.</p><p>But you can&#39;t use it with a completed sentence.</p><p>You can use it with a complete sentence in order to conjecture that that statement is</p><p>the case, but you can&#39;t use it with <code>か</code> to use a complete sentence as a simile.</p><p>You have to use <code>かのようだ/かのように</code> for that.</p><p>The other thing to note is that sometimes, probably because it is very casual,</p><p>the <code>だ</code> or <code>です</code> gets left off from <code>みたい</code>.</p><p>You might say <code>まるでヒツジみたい</code> - <code>just like a sheep</code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>This isn&#39;t correct grammar - you ought to say <code>みたいだ</code> - but it&#39;s very common to leave it off.
