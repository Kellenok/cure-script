It means...</p><p>oh, forget it, English is too complicated.</p><p>However, in Japanese, the figurative sense of <code>place</code> goes a lot further than it goes in English.</p><p>For example, if I say <code>さくらのどこが好きなの?</code></p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>I&#39;m asking, literally <code>Sakura&#39;s where do you like?</code> or <code>What place of Sakura do you like?</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>To quote Dolly-先生 in the comments: &#39;どこ means what it always means: <code>what-place?</code><br> I was simply demonstrating the use of the <code>place</code> metaphor in more abstract areas. If you look again at the sentence you will see that if どこ meant simply <code>place</code> it would make no sense...&#39;</p></div><p>Now, if I ask this, I&#39;m not expecting an answer like <code>I like her left ear.</code></p><p>An appropriate answer might be something like <code>やさしいだ</code> -- &quot;She&#39;s gentle /</p><p>What I like about her is that she&#39;s gentle / The place I like about her is that she&#39;s gentle.&quot;</p><p>And we might say <code>This is, in my opinion, Sakura&#39;s いいところ&#39;</code> -- &quot;Sakura&#39;s good place</p><p>or one of Sakura&#39;s good places&quot;.</p><p>So <code>place</code> here doesn&#39;t mean anything remotely like a physical location.</p><p>It means an aspect of something, even a really abstract something like a person&#39;s personality.</p><p>If I listen to a complicated lecture, someone might say to me <code>分かりましたか?</code></p><p>-- <code>Did you understand it?</code> -- and I might reply<br><code>分かるところがあったが分からないところもありました</code> --</p><p><code>There were places I understood and places I didn&#39;t understand.</code></p><p>And here, as you see, this is closer to a usage we might have in English:</p><p><code>I mostly understood it, but there were places that I didn&#39;t understand.</code></p><p>This could lead to a subtle misunderstanding in that what I&#39;m most likely to be saying</p><p>in Japanese is not that there were times during the lecture when I didn&#39;t understand, but</p><p>there were aspects or subtleties that I wasn&#39;t quite grasping.</p><p>So, especially if you&#39;re more advanced, it&#39;s good to be aware of this metaphorical depth of the concept of <code>place</code>.</p><p>Now, <code>place</code> is also often used to mean a place not in space but in time.</p><p>And if we understand this analogy, we can understand certain usages that are often explained</p><p>without explaining the structural underpinning for them, which ends up by just giving you</p><p>a list of things to memorize and as usual say &quot;well, this goes with this and happens</p><p>to mean that and we don&#39;t particularly know why.&quot;</p><p>So, for example, we can use <code>ところ</code> -- <code>place</code> -- with <code>A does B</code> sentences in all three tenses, that&#39;s to say, the past, the present, and the future.</p><p>So, for example, if we say, using the plain dictionary form of the word <code>食べる</code> -- <code>eat</code></p><p>(which, as we know, from our lesson on tenses is not present by default; it&#39;s future by default).</p><p>If we say <code>昼ご飯を食べるところだ</code>, what we&#39;re saying is <code>I&#39;m just about to eat lunch.</code></p><p>What&#39;s the structure of this?</p><p>Well, it ends with <code>だ</code>, so we know that what we have is an <code>A is B</code> sentence, even though the original sentence sandwiched into it is an <code>A does B</code> sentence.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we&#39;re saying that <code>(something) is place</code>.</p><p>The zero-car here is <code>it</code>, as it would be in English, and what it means is the present time,</p><p>exactly as it does in English when we say <code>It&#39;s time to leave</code> -- <code>the present time is time to leave</code>.</p><p>The <code>it</code> is <code>the present time</code> in both Japanese and English in these constructions.</p><p>So, we&#39;re saying <code>It (the present time) is I-will-eat-lunch time</code>, so what it means is</p><p><code>I&#39;m just about to eat lunch</code>.</p><p>So how putting <code>ところだ</code> onto this sentence changes it from what it would mean if we just</p><p>said <code>昼ご飯を食べる</code> is that it&#39;s telling us that we are right now at that place where</p><p>I&#39;m going to eat lunch, therefore I&#39;m just about to eat lunch.</p><p>NOT <code>I&#39;m going to eat lunch possibly in half-an-hour.</code></p><p>I&#39;m just about to eat lunch right now.</p><p>This is the place where I&#39;m just about to eat lunch.</p><p><code>昼ご飯を食べるところだ.</code></p><p>Now, if we use it with the actual present, the continuous present, which is what we use</p><p>when we&#39;re actually saying we&#39;re doing something right at this moment, so we say</p><p><code>昼ご飯を食べているところだ</code>, what we&#39;re saying is <code>I&#39;m eating lunch right now.</code></p><p>And just as with the previous example, what that <code>ところだ</code> is doing is making it immediate.</p><p>It&#39;s the difference in English between saying <code>I&#39;m eating lunch</code> and <code>I&#39;m eating lunch right now.</code></p><p>Now, in the past, if we say <code>昼ご飯を食べたところだ</code>, what we&#39;re saying is <code>I just ate lunch.</code></p><p>The <code>ところだ</code> is adding to that past tense the immediateness: &quot;The place in time that</p><p>we&#39;re at now is the place where I ate lunch / I just ate lunch.&quot;</p><p>Now, in this case we could say <code>昼ご飯を食べたばかり</code> - <code>I just ate lunch.</code></p><p>The two mean pretty much the same thing.</p><p>And I&#39;ve seen textbooks giving us this set of rules : &quot;You can use ばかり with a noun.</p><p>You can say <code>このお店はパンばかり売る</code> -- <code>This shop sells nothing but bread</code> -- or</p><p>we can say <code>昼ご飯を食べたばかりだ</code> -- <code>I just ate lunch.</code></p><p>But you have to remember that the rules say that <code>ところ</code> can&#39;t be used with a noun.&quot;</p><p>Now, this is true, but it&#39;s a strangely abstract way of putting it.</p><p>It&#39;s putting it as if these are just some random rules that somebody made up, perhaps</p><p>in the Heian era because they had nothing better to do with their time.</p><p>In fact, if we understand the logic of it, we don&#39;t even need to be told this, because it&#39;s obvious.</p><p>I can say either <code>I just ate lunch</code> or I can say <code>I&#39;m at the place where I&#39;ve eaten lunch</code>.</p><p>We can say <code>This shop just sells bread</code>, but <code>this shop bread place sells</code> doesn&#39;t make</p><p>any sense at all, does it? <em>(あのお店はところ売る = wrong)</em></p><p>And this is why I think it&#39;s so important to learn structure.</p><p>People sometimes say to me &quot;Am I supposed to be working out all this structure you teach</p><p>in every sentence I speak or read?&quot;</p><p>And of course the answer to that is <code>No</code>.</p><p>What you&#39;re supposed to be doing is getting used to Japanese by reading, listening, and</p><p>preferably speaking too. <em>(=The importance of immersion stated right here (๑˃̵ᴗ˂̵))</em></p><p>If you&#39;re not doing that, you&#39;ll never get used to the grammar however many textbooks you study.</p><p>But if you understand the structure you won&#39;t be confused by things like whether you can</p><p>use <code>ところ</code> with a noun or not, and why can&#39;t you use <code>ところ</code> with a noun when you can use <code>ばかり</code> with a noun, and you have to think all that out.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to do that because you understand how it&#39;s actually working.</p><p>This is what the textbooks could usefully be teaching, but they don&#39;t.</p><p>Now, having learned the structure, it&#39;s also important to be aware of the times when bits</p><p>of the structure can get left off.</p><p>As with many regular set expressions, the copula <code>だ</code> can be left off, and</p><p>more than this, even the end of <code>ところ</code> can be left off.</p><p>The <code>ろ</code> can be left off and we can just say <code>とこ</code>.</p><p>This is the case in all languages, that there are places where, colloquially, we can leave bits out.</p><p>And so long as we know what the structure is, it&#39;s not very difficult to understand the omissions too.</p><p>So, we might say <code>名古屋/なごやに着陸したとこ</code> -- <code>I just landed at Nagoya.</code></p><p>And we often use these abbreviations like <code>とこ</code> -- leaving off the <code>ろ</code> and the <code>だ</code></p><p>from <code>ところだ</code> -- when we are trying to express a sense of immediacy.</p><p>But people do it on various occasions, just as they do the equivalent thing in English.</p><p>So, we see that <code>ところ</code> can be literal, a <code>place in space</code>.</p><p>It can express very abstract concepts like an <code>aspect of someone&#39;s personality</code>, and</p><p>it can very often mean a <code>place in time</code>.</p><p>And it can be used in various ways as a place in time;</p><p>for example, if someone says <code>いいところに来たね?</code></p><p>That is most likely to mean <code>You came at a good time, didn&#39;t you?</code></p><p>NOT <code>You came to a good place, didn&#39;t you?</code></p><p>although in fact it can mean either.</p><p>Remember that in Japanese, context is king..</p>',110),p=[i];function d(h,r,l,u,m,g){return o(),t("div",null,p)}const f=e(c,[["render",d]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
