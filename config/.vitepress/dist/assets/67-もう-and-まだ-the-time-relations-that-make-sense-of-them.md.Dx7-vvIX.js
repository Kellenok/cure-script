All right.</p><h2 id="まだ" tabindex="-1">まだ <a class="header-anchor" href="#まだ" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;まだ&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, <code>まだ</code> has a less confusing collection of definitions.</p><p>Mostly we&#39;re told that it means either <code>still</code> or <code>not yet</code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So let&#39;s start by looking at what it really does mean, what it really does.</p><p><code>まだ</code> does a number of things.</p><p>It tells us about the present time.</p><p>It situates the present time inside a time segment that stretches back into the past</p><p>and is either expected to end or at least the possibility of its ending is being considered.</p><p>Most often it&#39;s expected to end.</p><p>Now, this does three things. It tells us about the present,</p><p>so we can say that it is in fact a way of saying <code>now</code>,</p><p>but <code>now</code> in a particular relation to the past and the future.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>What is that relation?</p><p>Well, as you see, we have two things.</p><p>We have the section of time in which <code>now</code> lies</p><p>and we have a transition point.</p><p>Since it&#39;s a section of time, it can&#39;t go on forever,</p><p>so there&#39;s a transition point at which it changes to</p><p>another section of time with other qualities</p><p>that is expected in the future</p><p>or at least considered as a possibility in the future.</p><p>Now, <code>まだ</code> gives us two contrasts.</p><p>The section of time is contrasted with the future when it will or may change, but</p><p>the present moment is contrasted with the past when it might have been expected to change.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what this means in English is essentially <code>still</code>.</p><p>And this may seem a bit abstract, but</p><p>I think we&#39;ll understand it clearly enough when we see how it works.</p><p>So, if we say <code>宿題はまだしなかった</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>I haven&#39;t done my homework yet</code></p><p>or <code>I still haven&#39;t done my homework.</code></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, as you see, this means that we are in a section of time where I haven&#39;t done my homework.</p><p>This stretches back into the past and is contrasted</p><p>with a period in the future where I will have done my homework.</p><p>But the present time is being contrasted</p><p>with a time in the past where I might have or should have done my homework.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That&#39;s why we say <code>まだ</code> and that&#39;s why in English we would say <code>still</code> or <code>haven&#39;t yet</code>.</p><p>In other words, there&#39;s a time in the past where it might have been expected to happen, but it hasn&#39;t.</p><p>So it&#39;s still in a state which won&#39;t change until the future.</p><p>And this is what we mean by terms like <code>still</code> and <code>yet</code> in English.</p><p>If we say <code>さくらはまだ若い</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>Sakura is still young.</code></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now again, what we&#39;re saying is that<br> the present time is situated in a period where Sakura is young,<br> that period stretches back into the past and is expected to change at some time in the future.</p><p>She won&#39;t be young forever, she&#39;ll get older.</p><p>So we can see that the time period while Sakura is young is contrasted</p><p>with the future when she will get older.</p><p>But the present moment is being contrasted with the past.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>That&#39;s why we say <code>まだ</code> or why in English we would say <code>still</code>.</p><p>What we&#39;re saying is <code>She hasn&#39;t stopped being young yet</code>.</p><p>As opposed to the possibility that she stopped being young in the past,</p><p>she hasn&#39;t stopped being young in the past -- she&#39;s still young now,</p><p>even though she won&#39;t be young in the future.</p><p>If we say <code>さくらはまだ大人ではない</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>Sakura is not yet grown-up</code>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So now we&#39;re using the negative, and that&#39;s why <code>まだ</code> can mean <code>still</code> or <code>not yet</code>.</p><p>It just depends, at least in this case, on the fact that it&#39;s being used with a negative.</p><p>So, if we say <code>さくらはまだ大人ではない</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying that at the present period Sakura isn&#39;t grown-up.</p><p>Even though you might have thought she&#39;d grown up a little while ago, she hasn&#39;t.</p><p>But of course she will grow up in the future.</p><p>As you can see, the reason why it gets translated both as <code>still</code> and <code>not yet</code></p><p>is because Japanese puts things a little bit differently from English.</p><p>In English we say <code>Sakura is not yet grown-up</code>.</p><p>But in Japanese what we actually say is <code>Sakura is still not grown up</code>.</p><p>However, for <code>まだ</code> to mean <code>not yet</code> we don&#39;t have to have an explicit negative.</p><p>For example, if someone says to you</p><p><code>日本語は上手いね</code> -- <code>Your Japanese is very good, isn&#39;t it?</code></p><p>Well, Japanese people tend to say that even if you can stagger out <code>こんにちは</code>.</p><p>And even if your Japanese really is very good,</p><p>you&#39;ll probably reply <code>いえまだまだです</code>.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>まだまだ</code> in this case means <code>not yet</code>.</p><p>In other words, we&#39;re still in the time period where my Japanese isn&#39;t good.</p><p>The change didn&#39;t take place in the past, as you are saying;</p><p>it will have to take place in the future.</p><p>And just a little cultural note In the West it can sometimes be considered a bit rude to contradict someone who&#39;s said something nice to you,</p><p>but in Japanese we do that all the time.</p><p>It&#39;s considered a bit arrogant not to.</p><h2 id="もう" tabindex="-1">もう <a class="header-anchor" href="#もう" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;もう&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, let&#39;s move on to <code>もう</code>, where we get a few more apparent complications,</p><p>but they aren&#39;t really complications, as we&#39;re going to see.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>もう</code> is essentially the opposite of <code>まだ</code>.</p><p>The best translation for it in English is that it means <code>already</code>.</p><p>What it means is that we are now in a time segment stretching forward into the future.</p><p>So, just the other way around from <code>まだ</code>.</p><p>The time segment is compared to the past when the current conditions didn&#39;t prevail</p><p>and now is compared to the future when the transition might have been expected to happen,</p><p>but in fact it&#39;s already happened.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So if someone says <code>宿題をしなさい。</code> (<code>Do your homework!</code>),</p><p>you might reply <code>もうやったよ</code> (<code>I already did it</code>).</p><p>So what we&#39;re saying is</p><p>we are now in the time segment where my homework is done, I&#39;ve done it,</p><p>and the transition isn&#39;t going to happen in the future, as you might think;</p><p>It&#39;s already happened in the past.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So why is it sometimes translated as having different meanings from <code>already</code>, such as <code>now</code>?</p><p>Well, as we&#39;ve seen, both <code>まだ</code> (<code>still</code>) and <code>もう</code> (<code>already</code>) are in fact species of <code>now</code>.</p><p>We&#39;re talking about now.</p><p>We&#39;re just making different contrasts with the past and the future when we talk about now.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, of course, <code>もう</code> does mean <code>now</code>, just as <code>already</code> does.</p><p>But because words in different languages very rarely</p><p>occupy exactly the same stretch of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpiELpGR-VU&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>meaning spectrum</strong></a>,</p><p>sometimes we use <code>もう</code> in places where we would use <code>now</code> in English.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And because J-E dictionaries are Anglocentric</p><p>they will try to translate <code>もう</code> as meaning <code>now</code> in those cases.</p><p>So, for example, if you&#39;ve hurt yourself and you&#39;re getting up and somebody says <code>大丈夫?</code></p><p>and you reply <code>もう大丈夫</code>,<br> how you would translate this into English is usually <code>I&#39;m all right now</code>.</p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In English you wouldn&#39;t usually say <code>I&#39;m already all right</code>.</p><p>Now, in Japanese you could also say <code>今大丈夫</code>, which also means <code>I&#39;m all right now</code>,</p><p>but when you say <code>もう大丈夫</code> you&#39;re specifically adding the nuance that,</p><p>while you weren&#39;t all right before, you are now,</p><p>as opposed to at some time in the near future, all right.</p><p>In other words, you don&#39;t need any more time to recover, you&#39;re okay.</p><p>In English, we don&#39;t use <code>already</code> for that.</p><p>Logically we could, but in practice we usually don&#39;t.</p><p>Now, it&#39;s perfectly true to say that <code>もう</code> is also used as an expression of annoyance or exasperation: <code>もう!</code></p><p><img src="'+_+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And it compresses all kinds of complaints or grumbles, or it can just be on its own: <code>もう!</code></p><p>How does that work?</p><p>Interestingly, <code>already</code> can in some circumstances have a little bit of that kind of nuance in English.</p><p>So, if someone says <code>Enough already!</code> what they mean is,</p><p>at this point, as opposed to at some point in the future, I&#39;m fed up with it.</p><p>And that&#39;s really what <code>もう!</code> tends to mean in Japanese. So that&#39;s really simple enough.</p><h3 id="second-もう" tabindex="-1">Second もう? <a class="header-anchor" href="#second-もう" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Second もう?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>However, there is one aspect of <code>もう</code> which is a tiny bit confusing until you understand it,</p><p>and that is that there are really two words <code>もう</code>.</p><p>Now, this may be a little bit controversial, but in fact in pitch-accent dictionaries</p><p>they&#39;re actually given two different accentuations,</p><p>one for the <code>もう</code> that we&#39;ve been talking about, the one that means <code>already</code>,</p><p>and one for another <code>もう</code>, which is quite close in many respects</p><p>and I&#39;ll explain why it&#39;s quite close later.</p><p>But first of all let&#39;s look at the area where it isn&#39;t so close.</p><p>This second <code>もう</code>, I think, is ultimately related to the particle <code>も</code></p><p>and it has the same additive kind of meaning of <code>another</code>.</p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So if we say <code>もう一つ</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>another one</code>.</p><p>If we&#39;re saying <code>もう一人</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>another person</code>.</p><p>So, when we put it like that, we can see</p><p>we&#39;re really dealing with two separate words, two separate concepts.</p><p>Now, it then becomes a little bit more confusing, and I&#39;m going to tell you why.</p><p>It even confuses Japanese people,</p><p>who actually don&#39;t do this pitch accent thing right in many cases,</p><p>because the idea that they are two different words</p><p>often gets rather lost even by Japanese natives.</p><p>And the reason for that is that there are many cases where they get pretty close.</p><p>Why? Well, as we&#39;ve seen, <code>もう</code> tells us about a time relation,</p><p>it&#39;s a time-related word, and it means <code>already</code>.</p><p>And also the dictionaries tell us that it means <code>soon</code>.</p><p>Why do they say that it means <code>soon</code>?</p><p>Well, it doesn&#39;t mean soon on its own, but it means <code>soon</code> in certain combinations.</p><p>So, for example, if we say <code>もうすぐ</code>, which means <code>soon</code>, what we&#39;re really saying is:</p><p><code>すぐ</code> means <code>soon</code> and <code>もう</code> means <code>already</code>, so that <code>もう</code> is emphasizing the <code>soon</code>:</p><p>it&#39;s already soon, it&#39;s not going to be soon at some point in the future, it&#39;s soon right now.</p><p><img src="'+v+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, we can also say <code>もう少し</code>.</p><p>For example, if some people are walking somewhere and they&#39;ve been walking for a long time</p><p>and they&#39;re getting tired, someone might say <code>もう少し!</code></p><p>which means <code>just a little more / just a little extra</code>.</p><p>And it could mean <code>just a little more effort</code>, but it can also mean <code>just a little more time</code>.</p><p><img src="'+I+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, you see, <code>もうすぐ</code> and <code>もう少し</code>, even though they&#39;re different words <code>もう</code>,</p><p>under some circumstances have a very similar meaning.</p><p>And the other <code>もう</code>, the additive <code>もう</code>, also is often used to express time relation.</p><p>So if we say <code>もう一度</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>one more time</code>.</p><p>Now obviously this means very much the same as it means when we say <code>もう一つ</code>,</p><p>which means <code>one more thing</code> -- one more candy, one more anything.</p><p>But it also is very often used with <code>一度</code>: one more time.</p><p><code>もう二度来ない</code> means <code>I&#39;ll never come again</code>, literally <code>I won&#39;t come for another second time</code>.</p><p><img src="'+S+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we can see that the two <code>もう</code>s tread fairly closely toward the same territory.</p><p>They can both be used for time relations and in a few contexts,</p><p>like <code>もう少し</code> and <code>もうすぐ</code>, the meaning is almost identical.</p><p>But once we understand the two and how they work,</p><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be any more room for confusion…</p><p><img src="'+x+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Will add this here:*<br><img src="'+z+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div>',202),A=[T];function E(B,J,N,q,D,P){return o(),t("div",null,A)}const F=e(W,[["render",E]]);export{C as __pageData,F as default};
