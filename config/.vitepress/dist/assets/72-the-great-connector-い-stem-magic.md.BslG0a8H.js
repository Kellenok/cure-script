kept secrets of Japanese structure - The Great Connector (い-stem magic) | Lesson 72</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about</p><p>one of the most versatile aspects of Japanese structure.</p><p>It covers a number of areas that can be compared to other aspects of Japanese structure</p><p>and it&#39;ll make life a lot simpler if we make those comparisons, so that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do.</p><p>This is something that isn&#39;t really explained well by most textbooks,</p><p>largely because they don&#39;t recognize the verb-stem system,</p><p>which is absolutely central to the way Japanese verbs work.</p><p>So, what it is, what we are going to talk about, is the い-stem of Japanese verbs.</p><p>In Japanese this is called the <code>連用形 / れんようけい</code>, which means the <code>connective use form</code>.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And we might call it <code>The Great Connector</code>, because it does a whole range of different connecting jobs, which we&#39;re going to talk about now.</p><p>In English it&#39;s sometimes called the <code>ます stem</code>, which is not inaccurate because of course</p><p>it does, among many, many other things, connect the helper-verb <code>ます</code>.</p><p>I don&#39;t like this expression because it stems from the whole ecology where</p><p>the so-called ます-form of verbs, which means verbs shifted into the い-stem</p><p>and having the <code>ます</code> helper verb attached to them, were the base-form of verbs.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s not the base-form of verbs.</p><p>It&#39;s just verbs with one among many other helper-elements attached to them.</p><p>And if we think it&#39;s the base-form of verbs</p><p>we&#39;re going to get very confused about what verbs are and how they work.</p><p>And I&#39;ve done a video about that, so if you&#39;re in any doubt about all of this,</p><p>you might want to watch that.</p><p>So, what is this い-stem, this <code>連用形 / れんようけい</code> and why is it so important?</p><p>Well, obviously, what it is is simply the verb shifted from its base う-row form to the い-row.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So that く-ending verbs end in -き, す-ending verbs end in -し, and so forth.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Because this is such a wide-ranging structural element,</p><p>I&#39;m going to compare it to a couple of different things.</p><p>The first thing, the most obvious thing, to compare it to is the other three verb-stems.</p><p>It&#39;s similar to them, of course, because like all of them,</p><p>it is used for attaching fundamental helpers.</p><p>And by fundamental helpers I mean the things that</p><p>sometimes get called <code>conjugations</code> in the textbooks.</p><p>As we know, there is no such thing as conjugation in Japanese. <em>(or rather in the Western sense)</em></p><p>There are just the four stems and various helper verbs, nouns and adjectives,</p><p>some of which get arbitrarily called <code>conjugations</code>, some of which don&#39;t,</p><p>and depending on which textbook you read, you&#39;ll probably get a slightly different take</p><p>on which ones are <code>conjugations</code> and which aren&#39;t,</p><p>which is perfectly natural because it&#39;s a wholly arbitrary category anyway --</p><p>there&#39;s no such thing as conjugation in Japanese, so the whole thing is fantasy.</p><p>And we don&#39;t necessarily expect consistency in fantasy.</p><hr><p>So, the い-stem, as we know, connects the <code>ます</code> helper verb.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It also connects a variety of what we may call dedicated helper nouns and helper adjectives.</p><p>Generally, if we&#39;re going to attach a helper adjective or a helper noun to a verb,</p><p>we&#39;re going to attach it to the い-stem.</p><p>This isn&#39;t absolute, but it happens nearly all the time.</p><p>As we know, the helper adjective -ない attaches to the あ-stem, but that&#39;s unusual.</p><p>So, we can attach a variety of helper adjectives to the い-stem.</p><p>For example, I&#39;m going to take the verb <code>読む</code></p><p>as our model for most of what we&#39;re doing today.</p><p>So let&#39;s take the verb <code>読む</code> and turn it to the い-stem <code>読み</code> and we can attach adjectives</p><p>like <code>やすい</code>: <code>読みやすい</code> (easy to read), <code>にくい</code>: <code>読みにくい</code> (hard to read).</p><hr><p>We also attach things like <code>ながら</code>.<br><code>ながら</code> means doing one thing while doing another, so we can say <code>歩きながら読む</code></p><p>or <code>読みながら音楽を聴く</code>: so that&#39;s <code>while walking, I read</code>, <code>while reading, I listen to music</code>.</p><hr><p>The <code>そう</code> helper, which gives us the meaning of likeness,</p><p>that also is attached to verbs with the い-stem.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we say <code>雨が降りそうだ</code> (it looks like rain) / <em>Rain is fall-seeming.</em></p><p>and I&#39;ve talked about this <code>そう</code> form and various related structures in another video, which I&#39;ll link. <em>(Lesson 24)</em></p><h2 id="連用形-connector-the-て-form-connector" tabindex="-1">連用形 connector &amp; the て-form connector <a class="header-anchor" href="#連用形-connector-the-て-form-connector" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;連用形 connector &amp; the て-form connector&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, this shifts into the area where we can start to compare the い-stem,</p><p>the <code>連用形</code>, the Great Connector, to the て-form.</p><p>Now, the て-form is the other great connector, of course.</p><p>It connects all kinds of things.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The い-stem is an even greater connector:</p><p>it can connect most of the kinds of things that the て-form also connects</p><p>and it can do a lot else beside.</p><p>So, with the て-form we often connect helper verbs that are not dedicated helpers,</p><p>that have a life of their own outside their helper capacity.</p><p>So we say <code>持って来る</code>, which means <code>fetch</code> (hold + come);</p><p>we can say <code>やって見る</code> (give it a try, literally do + see).</p><h3 id="compound-verbs" tabindex="-1">Compound verbs <a class="header-anchor" href="#compound-verbs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Compound verbs&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Now, in the same way we can produce compound verbs with the い-stem.</p><p>For example, we say <code>振り回す</code> (wave around).</p><p>And to return to our friend <code>読む</code>, we can say <code>読み始める</code>, which means <code>start reading</code></p><p>or <code>読み込む</code>, which means read + pack in, which actually means <code>load</code> in the computer sense.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And I&#39;ve done a whole video on this <code>込む</code> which you can watch if you&#39;re interested. <em>(Lesson 57)</em></p><p>I&#39;ll put a link above and in the information section below along with everything else.</p><p>On a computer loading screen, you&#39;ll often see <code>読み込み中</code>, which is interesting,</p><p>because here you see we have two い-stems, stacked together.</p><p><code>読み込む</code> itself takes the い-stem and connects to <code>中</code> (middle).</p><p>So <code>読み込み中</code> is literally read + pack in + middle -- <code>in the process of loading</code>.</p><p>And this, of course, is a noun: <code>中</code> is a noun and</p><p>any compound takes on the character of its last element in Japanese.</p><p>So, <code>読み込み中</code> is a noun formed by a compound of two い-stem verbs and a noun.</p><h3 id="joining-verbs-to-nouns-to-make-new-nouns" tabindex="-1">Joining verbs to nouns to make new nouns <a class="header-anchor" href="#joining-verbs-to-nouns-to-make-new-nouns" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Joining verbs to nouns to make new nouns&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And this leads on to something that the い-stem can do that the て-form can&#39;t.</p><p>And that is, join verbs to nouns to make new nouns.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, for example, we have <code>泣き虫</code>: <code>泣き</code> is the い-stem of <code>泣く</code> (cry), <code>虫</code> means <code>insect</code>.</p><p>So <code>泣き虫</code> is a <code>cry-bug</code>, which is the Japanese term for a crybaby.</p><p>And to come again to our friend <code>読む</code>, we can have <code>読み方</code>:</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>方 / かた</code> means <code>form, or manner, or way</code> --</p><p>you may have heard of <code>方</code> in karate, the martial art --</p><p>so <code>読み方</code> means <code>form or manner or way of reading</code>,</p><p>and what this usually means is the pronunciation of a kanji,</p><p>the way of reading the kanji in a particular context.</p><p>So, the い-stem has the compound word capacity of the て-form</p><p>and takes it further than the て-form.</p><p>And it can also take on another of the て-form&#39;s fundamental functions,</p><p>because, as we know, the て-form can connect the two halves of a compound sentence.</p><p>We could say <code>お店に行ってパンを買った</code>.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So we have two logical clauses there: <code>I went to the shops</code> and <code>I bought some bread</code>.</p><p>And instead of using <code>and</code>, the way we do in English, we use the て-form.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>You can check <a

<code>休み</code> is <code>a rest</code>, the noun <code>rest</code>.</p><p>And we use this both on its own and in compounds like <code>夏休み</code>,</p><p>which means <code>summer vacation</code> or <code>summer break</code>.</p><p>And, we see, we wouldn&#39;t call it the <code>summer rest</code> in English,</p><p>but that&#39;s because, as we&#39;ve discussed before, it&#39;s very rare for a Japanese word</p><p>to cover exactly the same area of the meaning spectrum as an English word.</p><p>So the word <code>休み</code> can mean <code>rest</code> literally as in lying down, taking a rest;</p><p>it can mean being off school or off work because you&#39;re sick;</p><p>it can mean a vacation, like <code>夏休み</code>.</p><p>But the point is that the verb-form is <code>休む</code>, the noun-form is <code>休み</code>.</p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And just about any verb that can have, logically, a noun-form</p><p>will have that noun-form represented by the い-stem of the verb.</p><p>And very often these will be the same thing in English; sometimes they will be different.</p><p>So, for example, <code>痛む</code> means <code>hurt</code>; <code>痛み</code> means <code>pain</code>.</p><p><img src="'+_+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Again, we have the noun-form of <code>hurt</code>, which is <code>pain</code>.</p><p>And this is very important because</p><p>not only does it give us this whole range of verb-formed nouns,</p><p>but also it plays a role in other structures which are very rarely explained by the textbooks.</p><hr><p>So if we say, for example, <code>お店にパンを買いに行く</code> or <code>公園に遊びに行く</code>,</p><p><img src="'+I+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>what do we mean by the い-stem of <code>買う</code>, which is <code>買い</code>,</p><p>or the い-stem of <code>遊ぶ</code>, which is <code>遊び</code>?</p><p>What we mean is the noun, so when we say <code>公園に遊びに行く</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re marking the locational target of the place we&#39;re going -- we&#39;re going to the park, <code>公園</code> --</p><p>and then we&#39;re stating our purpose. --</p><p>Our purpose is the thing of playing, the thing of having fun, and that is <code>遊び</code>.</p><p>So literally we&#39;re saying <code>I&#39;m going to the park for play</code>.</p><p>If we say <code>お店にパンを買いに行く</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>I&#39;m going to the shops for bread-buying</code>.</p><p>This is how these are structured, and I think very few textbooks actually ever explain</p><p>that what we&#39;re using here is the noun-form of the verb.</p><p>And that&#39;s important, because as I taught in our lesson on the logical particles <em>(Lesson 8b)</em>,</p><p>the five main logical particles can only be attached to nouns. <em>(が, を, の, に, へ, で)</em></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Just like Dolly remarks in Lesson 8b, の is also part of the logical particles,</p></div><p>So if it&#39;s not explained that the <code>遊び</code> here and the <code>買い</code> here are nouns,</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what most learners think the structure actually is.</p><hr><p>And we&#39;ll find in various structures that the noun-form of a verb is used</p><p>and the structure only really makes sense</p><p>if we understand that it is the noun-form of the verb.</p><p>So here we have the い-stem.</p><p>It&#39;s the Great Connector and it&#39;s also the fundamental noun-of-a-verb-forming stem.</p><p>So it has a very wide range of applications.</p><p>It does all the kinds of things a regular stem can do,</p><p>it does all the kinds of things that て-form can do,</p><p>and it creates nouns out of verbs to be used as regular nouns</p><p>like <code>痛み</code> (pain) or <code>休み</code> (a rest/some rest)</p><p>and also for deeper structures like <code>遊びに行く</code> (going for play, going for the activity of play).</p><p>If you have any questions or comments <em>(again, it’s a good idea to read video comments after)</em>,</p><p>please put them in the Comments below and I will answer as usual.</p><p>I&#39;d like to thank my Gold Kokeshi patrons</p><p>and all of my patrons and supporters on Patreon and everywhere,</p><p>who make all of this possible.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>In the comments, there is this rather interesting comment by one shary0 about て-form.<br> If anyone wants to read up on い-stem in a more <code>text-booky</code> language - here is **<a href="https://jref.com/articles/renyoukei.107/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the source link</a>.</p></div><p>*<em>Also, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qj9ZkAC2tE&amp;lc=Ugy_D9a0k-_X9AujzO94AaABAg&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>this comment discussion under this video.</strong></a></em></p><p><img src="'+A+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>',221),j=[S];function z(C,J,B,T,W,q){return t(),o("div",null,j)}const N=e(x,[["render",z]]);export{E as __pageData,N as default};
