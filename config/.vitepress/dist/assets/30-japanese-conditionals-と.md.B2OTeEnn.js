What the textbooks don&#39;t tell you.</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to start talking about Japanese conditionals.</p><p>Conditionals are when you say something like <code>If...</code> or <code>When...</code></p><p>And in Japanese there are a number of different conditionals,</p><p>and this can cause some confusion to learners.</p><p>Which one do we use, and when, and why?</p><p>As usual, we tend to get a list of these things from the text-books with complicated instructions,</p><p>and as usual it helps a great deal if we can understand the underlying logic.</p><p>So, this lesson we&#39;re going to start with the conditional と.</p><p>Now, we&#39;ve already met this と.</p><p>It is the <code>exclusive and</code> particle.</p><p>I&#39;m not talking about Boolean logic here.</p><p>I&#39;m talking about the fact that Japanese has two words for <code>and</code> which are used to connect two nouns.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>One is や, and や is the same as English <code>and</code>.</p><p>It means one thing <code>and</code> another <code>and</code> possibly other things too.</p><p>If we say <code>hat and coat</code>, we may well have on shoes and skirt and pants and other things too, but we just say <code>hat and coat</code>.</p><p>In Japanese, if we say <code>ペンや本</code> – <code>pen and book</code> – we&#39;re saying, just like English <code>and</code>,</p><p><code>a pen and a book and maybe some other things and maybe not</code>.</p><p>But if we say <code>ペンと本</code>, that is exclusive.</p><p>We&#39;re saying <code>pen and book and nothing else</code>.</p><p>Now, this is important to understand because this is exactly the same と that we use as a conditional.</p><p>The textbooks tend to introduce this と as if it were something different from the <code>and</code> と,</p><p>but it&#39;s not – it&#39;s the same.</p><p>There is another と and that is the quotation particle which we&#39;ve covered at some length</p><p>in more than one lesson. That is separate from the <code>and</code> と.</p><p>But the conditional と is not: it&#39;s the same と.</p><p>And when we understand that, it becomes much easier to see what&#39;s going on with this particular conditional.</p><p>Now, one more thing we need to know is that this と is a particle, but it&#39;s not a logical particle. And it&#39;s not a non-logical particle either.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>What do I mean by this?</p><p>Well, a logical particle is a particle that marks the case of a noun.</p><p>Now, you don&#39;t need to know what that means – it&#39;s not important to get that theoretical knowledge.</p><p>What it means is, in plain English, that it tells us what the noun is doing in the sentence</p><p>in relation to other nouns and in relation to the verb.</p><p>The が particle tells us that the noun is being or doing something; the を particle tells us</p><p>that it is having something done to it; the に particle tells us that it is a target.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So what logical particles do is tell us who is doing what to whom and where and when.</p><p>Non-logical particles は and も mark the topic, which is not a logical construction.</p><p>They tell us what noun we&#39;re talking about but they don&#39;t tell us what part it plays in the sentence.</p><p>Now the point about logical particles is that they must attach to nouns.</p><p>They can&#39;t do anything other than attach to a noun.</p><p>And this is obvious, because that&#39;s their function – to tell us what role a noun plays in a sentence.</p><p>と is not a logical particle and therefore, while it can attach to nouns,</p><p>it can also attach to a logical clause and that&#39;s what allows it to be a conditional.</p><p>All right. So now we know enough to go ahead.</p><p>If I say, <code>冬になると寒くなる</code> – <code>When it becomes winter (or, if it becomes winter) it gets cold.</code></p><p>So why is this connected with the <code>exclusive and</code> function of と?</p><p>It is connected with it because what we are saying is that only one possibility exists,</p><p>only one result can follow from what we&#39;re talking about.</p><p>If winter comes, it will get cold – there&#39;s no other possibility.</p><p>If rain falls, the ground will get wet – there&#39;s no other possibility.</p><p>It can also be used in a hyperbolic fashion.</p><p>We&#39;ve talked about hyperboles before, haven&#39;t we?</p><p>This is where you say something that exceeds the truth.</p><p>And human language does this all the time.</p><p>So, someone might say <code>それを食べると病気になる</code> – <code>If you eat that, you will get sick.</code></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, this is not like winter coming and it getting cold or the rain falling and the ground getting wet.</p><p>It&#39;s possible that you might eat it and not get sick, but this is a hyperbole.</p><p>What you are trying to say to someone is <code>If you eat that, you will get sick</code>.</p><p><code>If you keep playing those games, you&#39;ll fail the exam.</code></p><p>Now again, it&#39;s possible that the person might keep playing the games and still get through the exam, but the hyperbole is <code>Do A and B will happen</code>.</p><p><code>Keep playing those games and you&#39;ll fail the exam.</code></p><p><code>Eat that and you&#39;ll get sick.</code></p><p>We are putting something forward as an inevitable result, an exclusive result,</p><p>a result to which no other alternative exists.</p><p>Now, we can also use this と to mean that something is necessary.</p><p>We can say <code>行かないとダメ</code> – <code>If I don&#39;t go, it will be bad.</code></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>だめ is in katakana, usually it’s done for style, to spot words better in-text/avoid confusion or for emphasis of it, maybe to give it more emotional force or such.</p></div><p><code>勉強しないと行けない</code> – literally, <code>If I don&#39;t study, it can&#39;t go</code></p><p>but what that means is <code>If I don&#39;t study, it won&#39;t be good</code><br> (<code>...it won&#39;t do</code>, as we might say in English).</p><p>And what it actually means is <code>I must study / I&#39;ve got to study</code>.</p><p>And very often you&#39;ll hear this just on its own.</p><p>For example, <code>逃げないと!</code> And that just means, literally <code>We don&#39;t run and...</code></p><p>That&#39;s to say, <code>If we don&#39;t run...</code></p><p>And the implication here is that if we don&#39;t run, something bad will happen.</p><p>So if in an anime somebody says, <code>逃げないと!</code> they&#39;re really just saying <code>Run! / We must run.</code></p><p>And in this sense, と, because it is so absolute, because it is so exclusive,</p><p>is stronger and a little more colloquial than similar uses like ば/れば.</p><p>And we&#39;ll talk about the ば/れば construction next time.</p>',84),d=[c];function h(r,u,g,m,w,y){return o(),t("div",null,d)}const _=e(l,[["render",h]]);export{f as __pageData,_ as default};
