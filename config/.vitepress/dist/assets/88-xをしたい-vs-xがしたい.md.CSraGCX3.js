How the logic never fails. Xをしたい vs Xがしたい | Lesson 88</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about</p><p>the core fundamental structure of Japanese</p><p>and a problem that troubles some people about it,</p><p>which I&#39;ve tried to lay to rest <em>(Lesson 43)</em> but there&#39;s still some difficulty,</p><p>I think, so I&#39;m going to try to tackle the question,</p><p>for what I hope will be the last time, today.</p><p>And in doing that we&#39;re going to look at a puzzle</p><p>that&#39;s posed by the title of a very popular work.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>It&#39;s been a manga, an anime, a live-action movie:</p><p><code><strong>君の膵臓を</strong>食べたい</code>, which means literally <code>I want to eat <strong>your pancreas</strong></code>,</p><p>and we&#39;ll talk about why it literally means that in a minute.</p><p>I didn&#39;t actually know what a pancreas was.</p><p>I thought it was a railway station in London.</p><p>But apparently it&#39;s a component that you find inside</p><p>the human body and things don&#39;t go so well without it.</p><p>I&#39;m not very clear on what you find when</p><p>you take off the front and back panels of a human body,</p><p>so we learn something new every day!</p><p>That&#39;s why this is classified as an educational channel, I suppose.</p><p>So, the question that will be raised by this title</p><p>in the minds of anybody who&#39;s got some grasp of the real structure of Japanese, is:</p><h2 id="why-is-the-particle-を-used-instead-of-the-particle-が-here" tabindex="-1">Why is the particle を used instead of the particle が here? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-the-particle-を-used-instead-of-the-particle-が-here" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why is the particle を used instead of the particle が here?&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>Why is the particle を, rather than the particle が, used here?</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>If we want to say what in English would be<br><code>I want to eat that <strong>bread</strong></code> or <code>I want to eat that <strong>cake</strong></code>, we would say<br><code>パン<strong>が</strong>食べたい</code>, <code>ケーキ<strong>が</strong>食べたい</code>.</p><p>And, as we see, <strong>the adjective <code>たい</code></strong>,<br><strong>the adjective of desire <code>たい</code>, is pointing not at me but at the cake.</strong></p><p><strong>The cake carries the が-particle, so that is what the adjective is describing.</strong></p><hr><p>And confusion ensues <em>(Lesson 9)</em> when we actually translate this as literally meaning **<br><code>I want to eat cake</code>, because that&#39;s not what it means.**</p><p><strong><strong>It means</strong> <code>cake is want-inducing (to me)</code>.</strong> <em>(私は) ケーキが食べたい。</em></p><hr><p><strong>But we also know that this adjective of subjectivity, like other adjectives of subjectivity,</strong></p><p><strong>like <code>怖い</code> (frightening), and also potentials like できる or 食べられる --</strong></p><p><strong>because potential is also a kind of subjectivity.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>It&#39;s something peculiar to the individual, whether they can or can&#39;t do a particular thing.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s not inherent in the thing itself.</strong></p><p><strong>That would be <code>可能性</code>.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>We know that all of these generally point at the thing that&#39;s possible, the thing that</strong></p><p><strong>induces the desire to eat, the thing that&#39;s scary, etc.</strong></p><p><strong>But also the polarity can be flipped.</strong></p><p><strong>And it&#39;s flipped particularly when there isn&#39;t an actual cause, an actual visible or</strong></p><p><strong>tangible cause of the subjectivity.</strong></p><h2 id="the-polarity-flipping" tabindex="-1">The polarity flipping <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-polarity-flipping" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The polarity flipping&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So if we say, <code>お腹が空いた、 <em>(zeroが)</em> 早く食べたい</code>, <em>- there seem to be 2 clauses, I guess?</em></p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>Tummy is empty, I want to eat soon</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Now that <code>たい</code> is pointing at me, not at any particular thing, like cake or anything else.</strong></p><p>Now, this is the point that a few people have actually resisted and said,<br> &quot;Well, can&#39;t we say that it&#39;s not really saying &#39;I want to eat&#39;,<br> it&#39;s saying &#39;food in general is making me want to eat&#39;?&quot;</p><p><strong>Well, it isn&#39;t actually.</strong></p><p><strong>It&#39;s your empty tummy that&#39;s making you want to eat.</strong></p><p>And we&#39;re going to look at some constructions today, and the one we&#39;ve just talked about</p><p>is one of them, that make it a 100% clear that <strong>not only in cases where there isn&#39;t a</strong></p><p><strong>cause of the subjectivity, but in some cases where there is,<br> the adjective of subjectivity can still flip its polarity.</strong></p><p>Now, why do people resist this idea?</p><p><strong>As a matter of fact, it&#39;s not unknown even in English.</strong></p><p>We can say <code><em>We</em> were <strong>happy</strong> that day</code>, in which case <strong>the adjective <code>happy</code> is pointing at us</strong></p><p>(we&#39;re the ones that were happy) or we can say</p><p><code>That was a <strong>happy</strong> <em>day</em></code>, and now <strong>the adjective of subjectivity is pointing at the day, which is the cause of our happiness.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We can say <code><em>I</em> am <strong>suspicious</strong> of her behavior</code> and <strong>the adjective <code>suspicious</code> is pointing at me</strong></p><p>(I&#39;m the one who&#39;s suspicious)</p><p>or <code><em>her behavior</em> is <strong>suspicious</strong></code>, and now <strong>the adjective <code>suspicious</code> is pointing at her behavior as the cause of my subjectivity.</strong></p><p>So this isn&#39;t something that doesn&#39;t happen, even in English.</p><p>For the reason, I think, that people become so agitated about this and so determined to find</p><p>quite unlikely ways of wriggling out of it is perfectly understandable.</p><p>It&#39;s because they may have spent months or even years in this terribly confusing world</p><p>where particles just change their meaning depending on which side of bed they got out of that morning.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>(Dolly here 👇 is making an example of the confusing <code>trying to force English into Japanese</code>)</p></div><p>So, &quot;<code>が</code> usually marks the subject of a sentence but it can also mark the object of a sentence</p><p>as in <strong><code>パンが食べたい</code></strong>, in which obviously the bread isn&#39;t the subject of the sentence;</p><p>it&#39;s me, &#39;I want to eat bread&#39;.&quot;</p><p><strong>Well, we know that this isn&#39;t the case.</strong></p><p><strong>We know that in those cases it&#39;s the bread that&#39;s the subject;</strong></p><p><strong>it&#39;s the bread that&#39;s making me want to eat.</strong></p><hr><p>And if we start saying<br> &quot;That the polarity can flip, doesn&#39;t that either break the model of Japanese structure<br> that gets rid of all these ambiguities or introduce new ambiguities</p><p>so, ooh there are special rules that sometimes it points this way and sometimes it points</p><p>that way&quot;, well, the answer to that is no, it doesn&#39;t matter to the model.</p><p><strong>It&#39;s quite irrelevant to the model.</strong></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Whether we choose</strong> to say <code>パン<strong>が</strong>食べたい</code> (bread is making me want to eat) or</p><p><code>パン<strong>を</strong>食べたい</code> (I want to eat bread) <strong>doesn&#39;t matter.</strong></p><p><strong>The only thing that matters to the model is that the particles are always doing the same thing.</strong></p><p>If we say <code><strong>パンが</strong>食べたい</code>, we&#39;re saying <code><strong>The bread</strong> <em><strong>(=Subject)</strong></em> is making me want to eat</code>.</p><p><em>vs</em></p><p>If we say <code><em>(zeroが)</em> <strong>パンを</strong>食べたい</code>, we&#39;re saying that <code>(I) want to eat <strong>bread</strong></code> <em>(=Direct Object).</em></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Here, zeroが is the implied/hidden <code>I</code> Subject, while パンを is the Direct Object = bread.</p></div><p><img src="'+t+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And the model doesn&#39;t care which way we say it.</strong></p><p><strong>The model is doing the same thing either way.</strong></p><p><strong>All the particles are doing exactly the same thing.</strong></p><h2 id="how-to-justify-the-model-grammatically" tabindex="-1">How to justify the model grammatically? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-justify-the-model-grammatically" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to justify the model grammatically?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, can we justify this grammatically?</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>So if we say, for example, <code>パン<strong>を</strong>食べたい</code>, surely the problem here is that<br><strong>with <code>たい</code> we have an adjective, so we have an adjectival sentence,<br> and an adjective, as we know, can&#39;t take a direct object.</strong></p><p>So how can we say <code>パンを食べたい</code>?</p><p>And the answer to this is really very simple.</p><p><strong>Japanese, as we know, is very adept at gluing</strong></p><p><strong>verbal elements together to make them into</strong></p><p><strong>one element or taking them apart at will.</strong></p><p><img src="'+t+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>And what&#39;s going on in a sentence like <code>パンを食べたい</code> is that<br><strong><code>たい</code> is no longer being attached simply to the verb <code>食べる</code>.</strong></strong></p><hr><p><strong>We&#39;re not saying <code>パンを</code> and then <code>食べたい</code>,</strong></p><p><strong><strong>we&#39;re saying <code>パンを食べ...</code> and <code>たい</code> is being attached to that entire unit.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>What we want is the action <code>パンを食べる</code>, so we can attach the <code>たい</code> to that entire unit.</strong></strong></p><p><strong>That&#39;s what makes sense of these constructions.</strong></p><hr><p>And while <code>パン<strong>を</strong>食べたい</code> <strong>is a less common way of putting it</strong>, and in general</p><p><code>何々<strong>を</strong>食べたい</code> is the less common way of putting it,<br><strong>there are some kinds of sentence in which it is the one that we always use.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>For example, <code>助けたい</code> (want to help) or <code>守りたい</code> (want to defend).</p><p><strong>We don&#39;t say</strong> <code>さくら<strong>が</strong>守りたい</code>,</p><p><strong>we say</strong> <code>さくら<strong>を</strong>守りたい</code>.</p><p><strong>And if we&#39;re talking about <code>正義</code> (justice) or <code>平和</code> (peace) or even <code>国</code> (country), it&#39;s the same.</strong></p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>We don&#39;t say Sakura is making me want to defend her, we don&#39;t say the country is making me</strong></p><p><strong>want to defend it, we don&#39;t say justice is making me want to defend it, or peace is making me want to defend it.</strong></p><p>We always say <code>I want to defend <strong>Sakura</strong></code>, <code>I want to defend <strong>justice</strong></code>,</p><p><code>I want to defend <strong>peace</strong></code>, <code>I want to defend <strong>the country</strong></code>.<br><em>(all as Direct Objects instead of Subjects as shown above since they are used with を particle)</em></p><p>Why is that?</p><p>Well, essentially <strong>I think the reason is that we are not talking about an impulse desire.</strong></p><p><strong>If we look at bread and we want to eat it</strong>, <code>Ah, パン<strong>が</strong>食べたい</code></p><p>(<strong>bread&#39;s making me want to eat it</strong>).</p><hr><p><strong>But we&#39;re talking here about things that are more abstract, things that are less impulsive.</strong></p><p><strong>And in the case of people, it&#39;s more respectful to say</strong></p><p><code>さくら<strong><strong>を</strong></strong>守りたい</code> than <code>さくら<strong>が</strong>守りたい</code>,</p><p><strong>because we&#39;re not saying that Sakura is an object</strong> <em>(implication-wise, grammar-wise she is:D)</em></p><p><strong>that makes me want to defend her, like a piece of bread that we might want to eat,</strong></p><p><strong>we&#39;re saying that the action of defending her is something I want to do,</strong></p><p><strong>which is more dignified in the case of a person.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>But in the case of, say, the country, or peace, or justice, or even a house or a park,</strong></p><p><strong><strong>we&#39;re talking about something less impulsive and more a decision of our own,</strong></strong></p><p><strong>if not a conscious decision, then a mindset, a way of thinking that is ours.</strong></p><p><strong>So we talk about that action <strong>as our own</strong> rather than something induced by the external cause.</strong></p><hr><p>If we do say <code>パン<strong><strong>を</strong></strong>食べたい</code>,</p><p><strong>this is likely to be in conditions where we&#39;re talking a little bit more generally,</strong></p><p><strong>we&#39;re not talking about that particular lovely smell of bread by which</strong></p><p><strong>the bread is making us want to eat it.</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re not talking about some candy we&#39;ve just seen that&#39;s making us want to eat it.</strong></p><p><strong><strong>We&#39;re talking about the general desire to eat bread.</strong></strong></p><hr><p>So <strong>we&#39;re more likely to say</strong> <code><strong>パンを</strong>食べたい時</code> (when I want to eat <strong>bread</strong>*=Direct Object*)</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>In the sentence above, <code>I</code> should be the Subject, which is hidden in Japanese as zeroが.</p></div><p><strong><strong>than</strong></strong> <code><strong>パンが</strong>食べたい時</code> (when <strong>bread</strong>*=Subject* makes me want to eat it).</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong><strong>And this isn&#39;t a firm and definite rule but this is the kind of tendency,</strong></strong></p><p><strong>the kind of reason, the nuance, which decides which way</strong></p><p><strong>we&#39;re likely to flip that adjective of desire, in this case, <code>たい</code>.</strong></p><h2 id="so-why-is-を-used-in-君の膵臓を食べたい" tabindex="-1">So why is を used in 君の膵臓を食べたい? <a class="header-anchor" href="#so-why-is-を-used-in-君の膵臓を食べたい" aria-label="Permalink

loading="lazy"></p><p>Well, essentially <strong>because again this is not an impulse to eat.</strong></p><p><strong>We&#39;re not looking at the girl&#39;s pancreas and thinking how delicious it

some emotional and quite complex reason to eat somebody&#39;s pancreas.</strong></p><p>So I hope this time we really laid to rest the final question of polarity switching <em>(of Lesson 43)</em>.</p><p><strong>It does not threaten the model.
