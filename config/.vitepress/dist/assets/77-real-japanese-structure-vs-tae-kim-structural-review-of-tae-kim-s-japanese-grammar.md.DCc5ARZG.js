Simple as that.</p><hr><p>What the が-particle does is, it marks the subject of the sentence,</p><p>that&#39;s to say, the thing that we&#39;re saying something about.</p><p>We&#39;re either saying <code>A is B</code> or <code>A does B</code>.</p><p>What the A-car is is the subject of the sentence, the be-er or the do-er of the sentence.</p><p>The が-particle marks this. It can never mark anything else.</p><p>But conventional Japanese makes a mess of this by misunderstanding some Japanese sentences to the point where it has to say that が only sometimes marks the subject of the sentence; other times it marks the object.<br> Now, this is nonsense and I&#39;ve demonstrated that it&#39;s nonsense.</p><p>が never marks anything but the subject.</p><p>Tae Kim tries to reconcile this problem by saying that が doesn&#39;t mark the subject</p><p>and even going so far as to say that there is no such thing as a subject in Japanese</p><p>and saying that there is a subject is simply imposing European concepts on the language.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, the truth is that every human language has a subject, which is what we call an A-car,</p><p>and a predicate, which is what we call a B-engine.</p><p>All we are saying when we say this is that every human language can say something about something.</p><p>It can take a particular thing and say a particular thing about it.</p><p>The particular thing it takes is called the <code>subject</code>.</p><p>The particular thing it says about it is the predicate <em>(=basically everything excluding the subject)</em>.</p><p>It&#39;s as simple as that.</p><p>If we don&#39;t have subjects and predicates we don&#39;t have language in any developed sense of the word.</p><p>All we can do, if we can&#39;t say a particular thing about a particular thing, is make noises</p><p>that express that we&#39;re happy or sad or angry or frightened, just as animals do.</p><p>Without subjects and predicates there is no language. Simple as that.</p><p>Different languages may deal with them in very different ways, but the concepts have to be there.</p><hr><p>Now, what is it that induces Tae Kim-sensei to declare that Japanese is so different</p><p>from any human language that it has no subject?</p><p>Well, ironically, it&#39;s the fact that he can&#39;t shake the Eihongo grammar approach</p><p>that continually imposes English structure on Japanese.</p><p>It&#39;s because they can&#39;t conceive (and apparently Tae Kim-sensei can&#39;t conceive either)</p><p>that the Japanese could ever take the ego out of the heart of a subjective sentence.</p><p>So, the example he uses to <code>prove</code> that Japanese has no subject is the phrase</p><p><code>クレープが食べたい</code>,</p><p>which of course in all the textbooks gets translated as <code>I want to eat crepes</code>.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Tae Kim-sensei’s explanation.</p></div><p>And, as usual in English, the experiencer of the subjectivity, the ego, is placed at the center.</p><p>That&#39;s the subject, that&#39;s the doer: <code>I want to eat crepes.</code></p><p>And of course the crepes are marked by が, and they&#39;re not the subject, are they?</p><p>So が isn&#39;t marking the subject. On this, Tae Kim-sensei and conventional Eihongo Japanese are at one.</p><p>Eihongo Japanese explains it by saying that が only sometimes marks the subject.</p><p>Tae Kim-sensei explains it by saying that there is no subject in the entire language.</p><p>But the simple reason for both these statements is a complete inability</p><p>to even consider the fact that Japanese might use different expressions from English</p><p>and that it could be possible to take the ego out of the center of a statement about subjectivity.</p><p>Now, the odd thing about this is we don&#39;t even have to go as far as Japanese</p><p>to know that this happens all the time. It happens in Spanish.</p><p><code>Me gusta el Tequila</code> is not saying <code>I like Tequila</code>, although all the textbooks will tell you it is.</p><p>It&#39;s saying <code>Tequila does pleasing to me</code>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now, this may not be the way English wants to put it, but it is the way Spanish puts it.</p><p><code>クレープが食べたい</code> means <code>Crepes are eat want-inducing (to me)</code>.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Again, this may not be the way English wants to put it, but it is the way Japanese puts it.</p><p>The が-particle is doing what it always does.</p><p>It&#39;s marking the subject, the doer, the A-car, of the sentence.</p><p>It&#39;s just that the subject, the doer, the A-car, of the sentence in Japanese is not the same as</p><p>it would be if an English person tried to express the same sentiment.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>The subject of the sentence is the crepes.</p><p>They are the one that&#39;s doing the eat want-inducing to the experiencer.</p><p>And if we understand this we don&#39;t have to say that が marks the subject some of the time.</p><p>We can see that が marks the subject all the time.</p><p>And we don&#39;t have to start saying that there&#39;s no such thing as a subject in Japanese.</p><p>Because the only language in which there&#39;s no such thing as a subject</p><p>is <code>wanwan</code> and <code>nyan-nyan</code> language.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Since I was not able to find anything about them, I am pretty sure it was a joke (￣□￣」)</p></div><p>Human language has to have subjects and predicates or it ceases to be language.</p><h2 id="the-metaphysical-trap" tabindex="-1">The Metaphysical Trap <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-metaphysical-trap" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Metaphysical Trap&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now, some of you may be asking, how can I say that my model is the truth?</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>And yes, Linguistics is in fact a scientific field too.</p></div><p>That the whole of conventional Japanese grammar is not true and Tae Kim-sensei,</p><p>whom I acknowledge to be a very fine mind, is also producing models that aren&#39;t true?</p><p>And the answer to that is, I&#39;m not saying that at all.</p><hr><p>There is no such thing as truth in language structure or linguistics,</p><p>just as there is no such thing as truth in science.</p><p>Humans have metaphysical minds.</p><p>They want narratives and they want truth and falsehood.</p><p>Both of these are inherited from deep and ancient metaphysical intuitions.</p><p>And I&#39;m not saying anything here about whether those intuitions are true or whether they&#39;re false.</p><p>All I&#39;m saying is, if they&#39;re true, neither science nor linguistics are the places to look for them.</p><p>If we have a model that is inconsistent and has to be continually shoehorned with rules</p><p>and exceptions to make it work, or we have a model that is too vague to be very useful,</p><p>and then we have a model that is precise and consistent and works all the time,</p><p>we&#39;re likely to say that that third model is the true one.</p><p>But in fact this is falling into the metaphysical trap.</p><p>I may occasionally speak that way myself, but let&#39;s be perfectly clear:</p><p>this is just really a trick of language.</p><p>When compared to the inconsistent model or the vague model,</p><p>the consistent and accurately predictive model is not <code>truer</code>, but it is more useful.</p><p>Science doesn&#39;t tell us truth. It predicts things.</p><p>It tells us that when we do A and B the result is going to be C.</p><p>This has nothing to do with truth, metaphysics, narratives or anything else,</p><p>it&#39;s just a method of prediction.</p><p>And if we can predict things, we can do useful things with those predictions.</p><p>It&#39;s exactly the same with language.</p><p>So the conventional model is sufficiently inconsistent that in many cases it&#39;s not fit for purpose,</p><p>at least not if we can find a better model to replace it with.</p><p>Tae Kim-sensei&#39;s answer to this is to create a model so vague that it&#39;s unfalsifiable.</p><p>Now, when we talk about models or theories, being falsifiable may sound like a negative, but it&#39;s not.</p><p>It&#39;s a positive.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Because if there are no circumstances under which a theory can be falsified,</p><p>then essentially it doesn&#39;t really mean anything.</p><p>Theories work by defining phenomena; that&#39;s to say, setting out their limits:</p><p>setting out the conditions under which they apply and the conditions under which they don&#39;t apply.</p><p>If we create one that applies under all possible conditions, then it really doesn&#39;t mean anything.</p><p>If you give me an object and ask me what it is, if I say it&#39;s a marble, or it&#39;s a box, or it&#39;s a twig,</p><p>you can verify or falsify that statement.</p><p>If I say it&#39;s an object, you can&#39;t falsify it, because everything is an object,</p><p>but on the other hand, I haven&#39;t told you anything worth knowing.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>This above portion was really good.

For some, Tae Kim-sensei’s explanation works way better than Dolly’s, and that is okay…if a person keeps going with the studies/exposure, they will eventually understand how the language truly works even if at first they were told conflicting info - due to how our brains restructure around and solve language problems by natural patterns, logic etc.</p></div><hr><p>What Tae Kim does with the が-particle is call it the <code>identifier particle</code>.</p><p>Now, if you went a bit further, that might be useful.</p><p>Does it identify the subject?
