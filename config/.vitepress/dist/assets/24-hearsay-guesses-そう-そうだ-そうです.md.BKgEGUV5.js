how they REALLY work.</strong></a></p><p>こんにちは。</p><p>Today we&#39;re going to talk about the helper noun <code>そう</code>,</p><p>which can mean either likeness or hearsay,</p><p><strong>either that something seems like something</strong> or</p><p>that we are <strong>stating not our own view or opinion but something we&#39;ve heard.</strong></p><p>Differentiating the two can seem difficult, especially when the textbooks give you a list of connections to nouns and verbs and various different things.</p><p>It&#39;s much less complicated when you understand the underlying principle, what&#39;s actually going on with <code>そう</code>.</p><p>So you don&#39;t have to memorize a lot of different things.</p><p>So, first of all, what is <code>そう</code>?</p><p><strong>It&#39;s the same <code>そう</code> that we learned about recently that comes in <code>こう-そう-ああ-どう</code>.</strong></p><p><em>(Lesson 20)</em></p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>So <code>そう</code> means <code>like that</code></strong>, which makes it of course a very good candidate<br> for <strong>describing something seeming like something.</strong></p><h2 id="そう-as-seeming-like-something" tabindex="-1">そう as <code>seeming like something</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#そう-as-seeming-like-something" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;そう as &lt;code&gt;seeming like something&lt;/code&gt;&quot;">​</a></h2><p><strong>When it&#39;s used in that way, we use it by attaching it to any one of the three engines.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>And remember, as we&#39;ve learned before, that each of the three engines can be moved behind other cars to turn them into adjectives. <em>(Lesson 6)</em></p><p><strong>Now, once -そう has been attached to an engine</strong></p><p><strong>the engine becomes a new adjectival noun.</strong></p><p>How do we attach them?</p><p>We do the same thing in every case.</p><p><strong>We take the last kana from the engine.</strong></p><p>That is the kana that makes it what it is, its active part.</p><hr><p><strong>So we take the <code>だ</code> from the だ-engine - the <code>だ</code> or the <code>な</code> from the だ / な-engine.</strong></p><p><strong>We take the <code>い</code> from the い-engine.</strong></p><p><strong>And from the verb engine, we take that last う-row kana.</strong></p><p><strong>And we just put -そう onto them</strong>, so it&#39;s a very simple connection.</p><h3 id="with-adjectival-nouns" tabindex="-1">With adjectival nouns <a class="header-anchor" href="#with-adjectival-nouns" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;With adjectival nouns&quot;">​</a></h3><p>And <strong>the important thing to remember here is in the case of nouns</strong></p><p><strong>we can&#39;t do it with an ordinary, regular noun.</strong></p><p><strong>We can only do it with an adjectival noun.</strong></p><hr><p>In other words, <strong>if an adjectival noun is an adjectival noun to start with,</strong></p><p><strong>we can turn it into a different adjectival noun with -そう.</strong></p><p><strong>If it wasn&#39;t an adjectival noun to start with, it can&#39;t be turned into an adjectival noun.</strong></p><p>So if we take adjectival nouns like <code>元気</code> (<code>lively</code> or <code>healthy</code>) and <code>静か</code> (which is <code>quiet</code>) -</p><p>if we say <code>静かだ</code> we mean <code>is quiet</code> - if we say <code>元気だ</code> we mean <code>is lively or healthy</code>.</p><p>If we say <code>元気<strong>な</strong>学生</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>a lively or healthy-<em><strong>is</strong></em> student</code>.</p><p>Now <strong>if we</strong> take off that <code>だ</code> or <code>な</code> and <strong>put on -そう</strong> - and we say <code>元気<strong>そうな</strong>学生</code>,</p><p>we&#39;re saying <code>a lively <strong>looking</strong>-<em><strong>is</strong></em> student/ a lively <strong>seeming</strong>-<em><strong>is</strong></em> student</code>.</p><p>Similarly, if we say <code>静かな女の子</code>, we&#39;re saying <code>a quiet-<em><strong>is</strong></em> girl</code>.</p><p><strong>If we</strong> take off that -な or だ and <strong>put on -そう</strong> and say <code>静か<strong>そうな</strong>女の子</code>, we&#39;re saying</p><p><code>a quiet-<strong>seeming</strong>-<em><strong>is</strong></em> girl/ a quiet-<strong>looking</strong>-<em><strong>is</strong></em> girl</code>.</p><p>So that&#39;s really very simple, isn&#39;t it?</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>As shown above, we take off the だ / な from the OG adjectival noun, but then when we connect -そう after it, we then still use the だ / な, but it instead comes from the そう part.<br> It may be framed a bit confusingly, considering the examples Dolly gives still contain だ / な.</p></div><p><em>So just in case, to avoid possible confusion…<br> Because apparently <a href="https://jisho.org/word/%E3%81%9D%E3%81%86" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>そう is an adjectival noun</strong></a> itself, so the だ / な probably attaches to そう.<br> Here, 静か is an adjectival noun to which is attached そう, another adjectival noun, that seems to serve as a suffix to which is attached な to connect it with 女. So 静かそうな is one unit.<br> This would align with Dolly’s orange comment just below about copula being used with そう.</em></p><p><em>This is just my limited understanding, so take this with a grain of salt.

and so on.</strong></p><hr><p>So, <strong>we connect -そう to the <code>連用形</code>, the い-stem</strong>,</p><p>the general-purpose connecting stem of verbs.</p><p>What do they mean?</p><p>Well, <strong>generally speaking, they mean that something appears to be about to happen.</strong></p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Once again, the reminder comment about だ being used after そう.</p></div><p>So, <code>雨が降り<strong>そうだ</strong></code> means <code>it <strong>looks as if</strong> it&#39;s about to rain</code>.</p><p><code>子どもが泣き<strong>そう*(だ)</strong>*</code> means <code>The child <strong>looks as if</strong> she&#39;s about to cry / <strong>seems as if</strong> she&#39;s about to cry.</code></p><p>And if you see that&#39;s quite similar to what we might say in English:<br><code>It <strong>looks like</strong> rain / it <strong>seems as if</strong> it&#39;s about to rain.</code></p><p>So these usages are really quite straightforward.</p><h2 id="そう-as-hearsay" tabindex="-1">そう as hearsay <a class="header-anchor" href="#そう-as-hearsay" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;そう as hearsay&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now what do we do when we&#39;re using <code>そう</code> to mean hearsay, to mean <code>I heard something - I&#39;m not reporting my own observation or feeling, I&#39;m reporting what I got at second-hand from somebody else</code>?</p><p>Some people would say that this is also a suffix and we have to observe different rules for applying it, <strong>but the truth is that it is not a suffix.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>The -そう we&#39;ve just discussed is a suffix.</strong></p><p><strong>We join it to other words in order to form a new word.</strong></p><p>Whatever the word was to start with, <strong>once -そう is attached it becomes an adjectival noun.</strong></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Seems to point to my previous idea above…</p></div><p><em>---</em></p><p><strong>This is not what happens when we&#39;re talking about hearsay.</strong></p><p>When we&#39;re talking about hearsay,</p><p>we use <code><strong>そうだ</strong></code> or <code><strong>そうです</strong></code> <strong>after the entire, complete sentence.</strong></p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>So the complete sentence becomes the A-car of the sentence</strong> and</p><p><strong>the <code>そうだ</code> becomes the B-engine.</strong></p><p>And <strong>the content of the sentence is now subordinate.</strong></p><p>So let&#39;s take an example:</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><code>さくらが日本人だ<strong>そうだ</strong></code>.</p><p>What we&#39;re saying here is <code><strong>I&#39;ve heard that</strong> Sakura is a Japanese person</code>.</p><p>So, <strong><code>Sakura is a Japanese person</code> is all taken together as Car A, the subject of the sentence, and then what we&#39;re saying about it is that we&#39;ve heard it.</strong></p><p>Why do we use <code>そうだ/そうです</code> to mean <code>I&#39;ve heard</code>?</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Well, if you think about it, it&#39;s similar to what we might say in English.</p><p>Suppose we say <code>Why isn&#39;t that car in the street any more?</code> and you say</p><p><code>It seems some masked people came and drove it away</code>.</p><p>Now, when you say that, what that means is that somebody told you that, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p>If you&#39;d seen it yourself you&#39;d have said <code>Some masked people came and drove it away</code>,</p><p>but when you say <code>It seems some masked people came and drove it away</code>, what you&#39;re saying is <code>Well, that&#39;s the story I&#39;ve heard</code>.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>I would check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSJukXcyccw&amp;lc=Ugy3WGJ0efK8lG72-N94AaABAg&amp;ab_channel=OrganicJapanesewithCureDolly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>this comment</strong></a> too...</p></div><p>And it&#39;s the same in Japanese only a little more systematically.</p><p><strong><code>そうだ/そうです</code> when added as the B-engine to an entire, completed sentence is always</strong></p><p><strong>saying that this is what we&#39;ve heard, this is the information we have, for what it&#39;s worth.</strong></p>',124)]))}const _=t(l,[["render",m]]);export{k as __pageData,_ as default};
