All right.</p><h2 id="the-potential-helper-verb" tabindex="-1">The potential helper verb <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-potential-helper-verb" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The potential helper verb&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, the first main helper-verb we&#39;re going to look at is the potential verb.</p><p>Now, we&#39;ve already looked, haven&#39;t we, at helper-words.</p><p>We&#39;ve looked at the helper-adjectives <code>ない</code>, which forms the negative, and <code>たい</code>, which</p><p>is used for the desirability of an action.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We&#39;ve also looked at the helper-verb <code>がる</code>, which is attached to an adjective.</p><p><strong>Now we&#39;re going to look at the potential helper-verb, and this attaches to the え-stem.</strong></p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>There aren&#39;t as many things we do with the え-stem</strong></p><p>as we do with the あ and い-stems, but there are some.</p><p>And only one of them is a verb, so there&#39;s no room for confusion here.</p><p><strong>The potential helper-verb has two forms, and they are <code>-る</code> and <code>-られる</code>.</strong></p><p>People can be a little disconcerted by <strong>the godan form of the helper-verb</strong> because it&#39;s</p><p><strong>just one character, る(ru).</strong></p><p>But that shouldn&#39;t worry you at all, and because it only ever goes onto the え-stem, can&#39;t be used on its own, it&#39;s very very easy to recognize.</p><p><strong><code>-られる</code> is the form of the potential helper-verb that goes onto ichidan verbs</strong> – and we discussed godan and ichidan verbs before, didn&#39;t we?</p><p>So, <code>かう</code> (buy) becomes <code>かえる</code> (buy-able); <code>きく</code> (hear) becomes <code>きける</code> (hear-able);</p><p><code>はなす</code> (speak) becomes <code>はなせる</code> (speak-able); <code>もつ</code> (hold) becomes <code>もてる</code> (hold-able)</p><p>and so forth.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>change to え-stem and then the godan potential form る.
