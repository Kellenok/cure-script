Is this something we can understand from an English point of view? I would say yes, it is.</p><p>We do the same thing in English, though not so much with verbs as with prepositions,</p><p>particularly the prepositions <code>up</code> and <code>out</code>.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>We eat things up, we make things up, we cry out, we lose out, we think up an idea, we think out an idea, etcetera etcetera. Now, <strong>Japanese doesn&#39;t have any prepositions.</strong></p><p><strong>None at all.</strong> If you think it has, it&#39;s time to throw that textbook out of the window.</p><p>What it uses in place of these English prepositions <code>up</code>, <code>out</code>, etcetera, are verbs -- helper verbs. And the difference between the Japanese helper verb and the English verb-helper preposition is first of all that there are a lot more of them and then, because of that, they&#39;re a lot more specific. If you look at the various ways in which English speakers use <code>up and </code>out<code> -- they even </code>peace out&quot;, whatever that means -- you can see that because there are only a few of them they get used all over the place in all kinds of circumstances and there&#39;s only a marginal amount of reason to the way they&#39;re used.</p><hr><p>Now, because there are more helper verbs, they can be much more targeted.</p><p>So, even though they&#39;re used widely, in a whole range of situations, we can</p><p>generally tell what any given helper verb is doing,</p><p>if we understand that we need a fairly wide interpretation.</p><p>So what <code>-ておく</code> is doing here is really what it always does.</p><p>If we say <code>窓を開けておく</code>, what we&#39;re saying is<br> &quot;open the window in order that the window will be open and probably that</p><p>ventilation is going to come into the room&quot;.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Open it for a purpose, put that action in place:</p><p><code>おく</code>, which means <code>put in a place</code>.</p><p>Put that action in place so that it will then　<br> change the circumstance in the way that we want.</p><p>In this case, airing out the room.</p><p>And the same with the <code>説明</code> here.</p><p><code>説明しておく</code> -- put the act of explaining, or the explanation, in place, so that, after that,</p><p>each group will understand what&#39;s going on, they won&#39;t be in the dark about it any more.</p><hr><p>Now, we can compare this with another</p><p>very common helper verb, which is <code>しまう</code></p><p>and its various variants like <code>ちゃった</code>, <code>じゃった</code> etc.</p><p>We could say <code>説明してしまう</code>,</p><p>but that would have a completely different implication.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>In this particular case it would probably mean something like<br> &quot;I&#39;ll go ahead and explain to them, even though that&#39;s not what I&#39;m expected to do,</p><p>or perhaps not what people want me to do.<br> I&#39;ll just go right ahead and explain to them<code> – </code>説明してしまう&quot;</p><p>In another situation we might say something like</p><p><code>聞かないでよ。さくらは説明してしまうから</code>,</p><p>which means <code>Don&#39;t ask, because Sakura will explain</code></p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>-- but what that <code>しまう</code> is implying is probably something like<br> &quot;Don&#39;t ask, because if you do Sakura&#39;s going to explain</p><p>and we&#39;re going to be stuck here for hours with Sakura&#39;s long rambling explanations.&quot;</p><p>So, <code>しまう</code> has a wide variety of implications,<br> some of them negative, not all of them negative,</p><p>but <code>おく</code> has a completely different range of meaning.</p><hr><p><strong><code>しまう</code> is talking about going ahead and<br> doing something, something happening by accident;</strong></p><p>as I said in the video on <code>しまう</code> <em>(Lesson 44)</em>,</p><p>essentially when it&#39;s in the past, all those things that we can mean by <code>done</code> --</p><p><code>I done explained</code>, <code>I done fell over, </code>she done stole my cake<code>, </code>I done won the lottery&quot;</p><p>-- doesn&#39;t have to be negative, but it has that exclamation mark feeling to it.</p><p><strong>It happened, even though you might not have been</strong></p><p><strong>expecting it or you might not have wanted it.</strong></p><p><strong>It happened.</strong></p><hr><p><strong><code>おく</code> doesn&#39;t have that exclamation mark feeling.</strong></p><p><strong>It has that workman-like feeling:</strong></p><p>it was done to put the action in place, to achieve a result, to change the circumstance from what it was before into one that is more in accordance with what we want,</p><p>whether it be opening a window or explaining to several groups what the situation is…</p>',65)]))}const v=t(c,[["render",d]]);export{y as __pageData,v as default};
